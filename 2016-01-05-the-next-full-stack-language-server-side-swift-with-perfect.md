I will keep re-iterating (for the next 6 months at least) that whilst Swift is not the first language from a commercial company to be open-sourced, the enthusiasm and outcomes so far have been astounding.

Swift 2.2 was open sourced just over a month ago on December 3rd 2015 under an Apache 2.0 license. It’s currently hard to find an exact list of projects interpreting and compiling Swift as opposed to written in Swift, but looking at the project’s GitHub repository shows the level of interest, activity and contributions to the project in such a short time frame.

The predominant problem for me (especially being a southerner) with jangly guitar bands singing with Northern accents, is that they all start to sound very similar, It's an unfair comment especially in You and the Atom Bomb's case. The two tracks on this single sound like different bands, which in my opinion, is a good thing. Track one is a fast-paced blistering riff led rant about and celebration of bad landlords and cheap rentals, track two a more laid back, melancholic affair about boy watching... I think. Overall, interesting, I'd like to hear more!

_(and how tools written in obscure programming languages helped)_

Just over a year ago I had a great idea for a boardgame where players get to run a computer company in 1980s America. As a programmer of over 15 years, it seemed obvious to me to code the game and this led me down a meandering path of obscure toolsets where I discovered some amazing gems.

In this presentation I want to introduce you to the why and how I did this, what I discovered, how it can help you and the digital future of cardboard.

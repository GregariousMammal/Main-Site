#Frequently asked questions

##How do I make an order?

##what is the minimum order?
The minimum order for a gift box is $22 (plus delivery/postage). 

##I want to send the box as a gift
No problem, just specify the name and address of the recipient. We can even add a printed message from you in a gift card, no charge. 

##How will I recieve my order
You order will be posted or hand delivered (in Berlin) for a fee. You also have the alternative of picking up your box from Prenzlauer berg. 

##Why don't you post vegan cheese?
Basically because it won't be refrigerated during postage time. Also cheese is quite delicate and might get bumped around despite our best efforts to post the package securely. 

##How long will delivery take?
Where absolutely possible, we will hand deliver on the same day (if you book before 10am) or next day during business hours. For hand deliveries there *must* be someone to receive the package (ideally you or the gift recipient). Otherwise we will need to bring the package back with us and you will incur an additional charge for repeat delivery.

For postal deliveries, we will post on the same day and arrival will depend on the timing of Deutsch post. We will let you know when your box is posted! 

If you request something that we are need to make more of, we will let you know and give you the option to order an alternative product.

##What will the box look like?
We focus on providing quality products for foodies and ensuring that the box gets to you securely. We've done careful budgeting. We'd honestly rather spend your money on both of these factors rather than an expensive box or basket and gift wrap and cellophane. You can of course gift wrap the items yourself! 

##Is everything really vegan?
Yes it is all vegan. Really.

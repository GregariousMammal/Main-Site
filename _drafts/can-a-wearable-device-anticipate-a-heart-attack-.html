<p><a href="https://www.ibeat.com/">iBeat's</a> Heart Alert &amp; Emergency Watch is a sleek and comfortable watch you wear 24/7. The device's medical grade sensors constantly monitor your heart activity and detect for emergencies. In an emergency, iBeat will alert you, your loved ones and 911, sending immediate care and potentially saving your life.</p>
<p>consider panic alarms (typically worn obtrusively around the neck on a lanyard) as dehumanising</p>
<p>Partner Dr. Mehmet Oz from <a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/">Dr Oz show </a></p>
<p>By perpetually monitoring for oncoming life-threatening heart incidents such as cardiac arrest (a sudden, sometimes temporary, cessation of heart function) or atrial fibrillation (an irregular, often rapid heart rate that can cause poor blood flow and lead to stroke), the iBeat Heart Alert &amp; Emergency Watch ensures you receive immediate care in the event of a life-threatening emergency.</p>
<p>According to creators, when it does detect a problem, the watch sounds an alarm asking if the user is “OK”. If there’s no response or if the user does push the “No” button, the watch will dial emergency services and any family members programmed into the device. All this can also be activated by the user holding down an emergency call button on the watch for at least two seconds.</p>
<p>Since it has its own cellular connectivity built in, it doesn’t need a smartphone to operate. Moreover, because there’s a GPS inside as well, it will provide the user’s location to emergency responders and family members to help speed up the response. The responders and caretakers receive a text message with a map of the user’s location, even if the patient is moving. This lets the medical team respond in an appropriate way, whether by sending out an ambulance or warning an emergency room to get ready for a new arrival, while family members are always aware of the person’s location and can come quickly to the receiving hospital.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/7000655/Builder-life-saved-by-Apple-Watch.html">saved by his Apple Watch</a>. Dennis Anselmo, a 62-year-old builder, felt “terrible” after taking lunch. Anselmo had a rest, and during that time looked at his Apple Watch, checking his pulse. He discovered that it was well over twice what it should be, registering 210 beats per minute.</p>
<p>Anselmo then called for an ambulance, and at hospital was later told that had he gone home he may well have died. Instead the doctors were able to clear his arterial blockage and he’s now doing well. And Anselmo isn’t the first person to claim that their Apple Watch has saved their life either.</p>
<p><strong>Predictive wearables are the future</strong></p>

<p>Predictive wearables are the future is the growth in their creation is anything to go by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VitalConnect has developed  a adhesive <a href="http://www.vitalconnect.com/healthpatch-md">health patch</a> of biosensors to continuously track comprehensive vital signs and biometrics wherever the patient is and transmit the data to the patient's healthcare provider, providing the ability to observe improvement or degradation on a real-time basis and intervene if necessary.The capabilities measured include Single lead ECG, heart and respiratory rates, skin temperature, fall detection and activity including steps.</p>
<p>The sensor itself is reusable, while a disposable patch, which comes with a choice of three adhesives, is used to stick it onto the chest.<br />
The sensor, which has a battery life between 48 and 72 hours, can share its readings with another device via Bluetooth 4.0.</p>
<p>For asthmatics, a Health and Environmental Tracker (HET) created at North Carolina State University is in the works incorporating a host of sensing devices , which are incorporated into a wristband and a patch that adheres to the chest.The patch includes sensors that track a patient’s movement, heart rate, respiratory rate, the amount of oxygen in the blood, skin impedance and wheezing in the lungs. The wristband focuses largely on environmental factors, monitoring volatile organic compounds and ozone in the air, as well as ambient humidity and temperature. The wristband also includes additional sensors to monitor motion, heart rate and the amount of oxygen in the blood. The system also has one non-wearable component: a spirometer, which patients breathe into several times a day to measure lung function.Whilst it's efficacy sounds promising it'S questionable how many people with asthma would comply with this somewhat onerous regime.</p>

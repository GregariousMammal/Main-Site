<p>There are <a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/about-dementia/facts-stats/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-prevalence/">850,000 people</a> living with dementia in the UK today, a number that will increase every year as the population ages. Through the rise of sensor based technology, aged care technologists have moved from creating reactive devices such as panic buttons  to adaptive technology devices which aid memory, monitor sleep, <a href="https://www.safewander.com/">location</a>, <a href="https://www.alarm.com/productservices/wellness.aspx">daily activities</a>,

<p>  food and water intake and provide family members and carers with r<a href="https://sen.se/store/mother/">eal time with remote information</a>. The overall aim is to achieve happier, healthier and longer levels is independence for the person with dementia in their own home instead of an aged care facility. Such technology also has the means to pick up signs of deterioration which may have otherwise lead to emergencies and prevent major incidents.</p>
<p>A ground breaking <a href="https://www.sabp.nhs.uk/news/tihm_dementia_trial/view">IoT trial</a>
<div id="SyUknNRQ4yQ04PnpmwM" style="width: 263px"><a href="https://www.levitradosageus24.com/how-long-does-levitra-last-in-your-system/">https://www.levitradosageus24.com/how-long-does-levitra-last-in-your-system/</a></div>
<p> funded by NHS England and<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk"> Innovate UK</a>, the first of its kind in the UK, is part of an NHS drive  to modernise healthcare for the benefit of older people with long term health problems. Called TIHM (Technology Integrated Health Management) for dementia, the trial will help clinicians to remotely monitor the health and wellbeing of people with dementia so they can intervene earlier to help someone avoid a crisis and unnecessary hospital stay. It is also hoped the trial will relieve pressure on carers and help people with dementia to remain independent for longer. The study is recruiting 1400 people (half with dementia of half their carers) to get involved. Half of the people with dementia will be randomly selected to receive the technological devices. The remaining half will form the control group and continue with their care as usual.</p>
<p>People receiving the technology will have their homes kitted out with non-invasive devices, such as sensors, apps and trackers. These will connect to each other via the ‘Internet of Things’ and work together to collect and analyse different pieces of information, that will be securely managed, about a person’s health and patterns of behaviour. The data will enable the devices to identify if there is a problem. If there is, mental health professionals will be immediately alerted and a decision taken about the action needed. This may mean a clinician is sent out to visit the person or a call is made to the carer.</p>
<p>Technological devices in the trial include sensors attached to objects such as fridges, kettles and beds. These can, for example, detect if someone is following normal patterns of behaviour for eating and drinking or is at risk of dehydration and whether they are unusually restless at night. The technology will not replace any existing face-to-face contact with health or social care staff.</p>
<p>Dr Ramin Nilforooshan, leading dementia specialist at our Trust, said: “The technology is designed to alert us to any changes in behaviour or any changes in wellbeing that could signal someone is becoming unwell or that they are in trouble. For example, they may be developing a urinary tract or lower respiratory infection. We could detect the early signs/symptoms of those infections and successfully treat them at home.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We know that people with dementia do not respond well to being in hospital – and that their symptoms can worsen in this environment so it is much better if we can treat them before they need to be admitted for acute care.”</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Usage of adaptive technology is not always easy. </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-015-0091-3">Research</a> published in 2015 into how adaptive technology is being used by people with dementia and their carers in their daily routines suggests that such devices are typically introduced too late into the progression of dementia, making it difficult to incorporate them into the daily need of the patient, particularly if they were not already au fait with technology such as mobile phones and alarms. There was frequently a mismatch between what carer thought people with dementia would be able to accomplish and the person’s with dementia actual capabilities in relation to learning how to use new technologies. As a result, carers could misinterpret the motives of the person with dementia as they struggled with well-meaning attempts to introduce new technologies, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="Par45" class="Para">"I bring something down, put it on that table and she just won’t touch it. I bought all sorts to try and help her; she’s just not interested. Buy something new and she’s not interested. As I say, I used to think she was just being bloody lazy, but that’s been explained to me that’s not the case. (Carer; C107)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Para">In practice, carers often had to support a person to use often even simple technologies, for example routinely telling them to look at a clock instead of simply giving them the time, or reassuring a person whenever tele-care alarms were triggered. This ‘background’ work also had to be continual. While appearing to be simple to use, many devices required a number of tasks to be completed in order to function; for example, ensuring a device was charged, or putting it in the same place each day.</p>
<p class="Para">It's easy to see the benefits of assistive technology, particularly in regard to remote settings but for it to be really usually, it needs to be understood and adopted by the person with dementia and their carer. Otherwise it is little more than a good idea. Hopefully this trial will offer some insights into the meaningful engagement of people with dementia with adaptive technology and how its efficacy can be increased.</p>

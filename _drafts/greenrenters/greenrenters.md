#GreenRenters

##What is Green Renters

In 2007 Chris Ward and Cate Lawrence started a blog for people interested in sustainable living despite residing in rental accommodation. This quickly grew to a not for profit charity which provided information and resources for people living in rental accommodation on how to live green as a renter. Their work included:

*  workshops and public forums
*  stalls at public events 
*  social media 
*  surveys of renters
*  events such as expos
*  extensive project work
*  campaigns and representation of issues relevant to renters. 

As the organisation is currently in hiatus, it's website has been transformed to a repository of resources and information during it's time of activity, which should prove of interest to renters and people working with renters.

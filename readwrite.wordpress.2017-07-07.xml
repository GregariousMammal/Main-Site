		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When you think of the Greek economy, it's easy to recall news images protests, mass unemployment and hardship. But the Greek tech sector is helping to lift the country's economic spirits.

Plagued by one of the worst economic environments since the Great Depression, political uncertainty and <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21664223-modern-society-can-function-without-known-comforts-and-conveniences-life-under-capital-controls">capital controls</a> that have stopped nearly all international payments in and out of the country, Greece’s mobile and tech companies have experienced it all. Some of these companies have not only survived but grown their businesses throughout the six years of Greece’s financial crisis, a testament to the resilience of the country’s growing mobile technology community.

The good news is found in an emerging ecosystem of incubators, venture investors and university entrepreneurship programs. There are more than 1,000 startups in Greece with over half in the technology sector in a broad range of industries, from aerospace and biotech to tourism and mobile apps. The rate of company formation has increased twelve-fold since 2010.
<h2>Great potential workforce for Greek tech</h2>
The tech sector is thriving, with a workforce of highly educated engineers and developers - many at a masters level or higher - according to Thanos Ganas, board member of the Hellenic Startup Association. They encompass both recent graduates and those laid off elsewhere due to the economic crisis.

With them comes a massive startup community of hubs and co-working spaces, including <a href="http://www.coho.gr/home/en/">Coho</a> in Thessaloniki and Colab, <a href="http://thecube.gr/">The Cube</a>, <a href="http://athens.impacthub.net/en/">Impact Hub Athens</a> in Athens. Business incubators and shared work spaces have sprung up across Greece, and conferences and forums on entrepreneurship and innovation abound alongside innovation hubs like <a href="http://www.corallia.org/en/">Corallia</a>, <a href="http://www.startupgreece.gov.gr/">Start up Greece</a> and <a href="http://endeavor.org.gr/">Endeavour Greece</a> and organisations like the <a href="http://www.sekee.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&amp;page=1">Hellenic Association of Mobile Application Companies (HAMAC)</a>.

Many involve international support - like <a href="http://orangegrove.biz/">Orange Grove</a>, a workspace for young entrepreneurs started by the Dutch embassy in Athens, together with a number of Dutch and  Greek tech sector corporate sponsors, charity foundations and universities. Its aim is to address the “brain drain” and youth unemployment in Greece. It welcomes startup founders under 40.

On a weekly basis, Orange Grove welcomes local and international speakers - often from the Netherlands and USA - who share their experience and expertise on a wide variety of topics. They focus on entrepreneurship, fundraising, personal skills, branding, and marketing and topics often include sales, legal issues, PR, logistics, and HR issues.

I spoke to just a few of the mobile and app Greek startups represented at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. From smartphone makers to marketing &amp; payments, the participating companies represented the whole ecosystem of innovation and technology in the country.

Spyros Karababas from <a href="http://www.softweb.gr/en/">Soft Web</a>, a company that specialises  in developing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=SOFTWeb%20-%20Adaptive%20I.T.%20Solutions&amp;hl=elhttp://pocketwarp.com/">web - mobile applications</a> and the delivery of i<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=SOFTWeb%20-%20Adaptive%20I.T.%20Solutions&amp;hl=el">ntegrated technology services</a>, explains the appeal of international networking to Greek startups. "The economic crisis made us forward-looking and keen to establish international partnerships," he says. "Four years ago, only one Greek company attended MWC, now this year there are 25 with another 55 represented by the Hellenic Startup Association."

I was interested in learning about some of the challenges specific to startups in Greece. Karababas stressed that many people had fled the country due to an inability to find work, particularly in the public sector, agriculture and manufacturing. He explained that his own company came from humble beginnings

"We started in 2007 at a time when no one was talking about mobile technology in Greece. We were three people working in a garage, and now we have grown to a team of 20 people."
<h2>But Greek tech has same challenges as all Greek businesses</h2>
He explained some of the particular challenges in running a business in Greece, particularly the capital controls that limit businesses registered in Greece to only transferring up to €500 out of the country a month. Naturally, this makes it difficult for anyone running an international business or using cloud services like web hosting or Paypal.  However, he said that tech startups essentially only need an apartment and a laptop, unlike other industries like manufacturing that were unable to function effectively under the capital controls.

Spiros noted that Greek tech entrepreneurs are an innovative group, many of whom collaborate and support each other through organisations like the Hellenic Startup Association. He stressed

"We have found solutions, we have created international accounts to support and teach other. Even though there are problems, we always find solutions."

One area of success is with startups focusing on the industries that are popular in Greece already, like tourism and hospitality. Tourism accounts for <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/can-greek-businesses-even-survive-1423615283">a quarter</a> of the economy in Greece, and the country ranks as the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/13/securing-startups-will-be-yet-another-gauntlet-for-greece/">seventh most popular destination</a> in the world. Soft Web has created many web-to-mobile apps in the tourism and hospitality sectors and also has clients in the US, London and The Netherlands.

I also spoke to Michalis Petrou, founder and creative director of <a href="http://nutrinsider.wix.com/saintiago">Saintiago</a>, and creator of <a href="http://www.nutrinsider.gr/">nutrINsider</a>, an all-in-one supermarket app, which organizes supermarket shopping through lists of products and provides nutritional advice. It also helps manufacturers to reach consumers with branded shopping offers, relevant recipes<strong> </strong>and other useful information at the point of purchase. The app was awarded “App of the Year 2015” by Infocom Mobile World and received a Silver award in the CYTA Mobile Excellence Awards 2015. Petrou has a background in advertising and was in a good position to work in retail technology.

Like everywhere else, there's a high danger of failure with startups in Greece as well,. But that a lack of other options for many people meant that they were more likely to start their own business. "You've literally got nothing to lose in starting a startup when there's no work anyway," Petrou says.

With an educated and innovative workforce, and great traction with angel investors through structures like <a href="http://www.businessangelsgreece.gr/">EVEA Business Angels Network</a> and <a href="http://blog.starttechventures.com/?p=934">Angels Group by StartTech Ventures Incubation Fund</a>, it's clear that Greece's startup sector is healthy. With their reputation growing, we soon might see people emigrating <em>to</em> Greece to join the burgeoning tech scene.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Germany has been long considered a country of scientific, technological and engineering innovation. This is reflected in the strength of  IoT technology which extends far beyond the automobile industry.  Keen to get a feel for an insider's perspective, I met with Martin Giess, <a href="http://www.emnify.com/">EMnify</a> co-founder and Chief Technology Officer and Frank Stoecker, <a href="http://www.emnify.com/">EMnify</a> co-founder and CEO.
<p class="">EMnify is  a next-generation elastic Cloud Service enabling enterprises and OEMs to connect M2M (machine to machine) and IoT devices globally throughout the lifecycle of a device. It uses provider-agnostic M2M SIM cards in combination with a custom-built, scalable, globally distributed Evolved Packet Core (EPC). It’s RESTful-API and management platform can be fully integrated into existing systems to aid monetization of IoT ventures. EMnify services are provided as SaaS and IaaS, supporting cellular and LPWAN connectivity.</p>
<p class="tmt-composer-block-format-target tmt-composer-current-target">EMnify was founded in 2014 and all three founders actively work within the company, first beginning work together in messaging in 2000. They became the first non-operator in SS7 messaging.</p>


[caption id="attachment_133" align="aligncenter" width="357"]<img class=" wp-image-133" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/giess-300x288.jpg" alt="emnify-1" width="357" height="343" /> EMnify CEO Frank Stoecker[/caption]
<p class=""></p>
<p class=""><strong>How has the IoT sector evolved in Germany?</strong></p>
<p class=""><em>Martin Giess: </em>“The IoT and M2M sector in Germany has evolved a lot in recent years. It’s gone from classic fleet management to be more focused on tracking any valuable assets - moving or stationary, from people/pets to high value equipment. In Germany in particular there’s been a lot of evolution around tracking construction equipment and high value machinery built by the German Mechanical Engineering Industry (Maschinenbau).</p>
<p class="">Initially, IoT systems started as simple alert systems such as emergency buttons in elevators that if pressed instantly call/alert an operator. Now, companies use IoT systems to remotely monitor and collect much more detailed operational data which is then analyzed using big data techniques. This enables predictive maintenance, remote diagnosis, optimization of resource utilization and efficient use of human work force. In this way, German engineers are now able to provide remote support for their customers all over the world, helping them to more efficiently run their machinery to the highest quality standards. This has meant that having assets delivered with built in connectivity and integrated cloud services is now recognized as an important competitive advantage.</p>
<strong>What are the particular challenges in the sector?</strong>

<em>Martin Giess: "</em>Security is still a pain point and the security risks that accompany complex IoT project are hard to understand. This is due to stringent security concepts and best-practice standards still evolving/being established.

This lack of standards, in conjunction with the general privacy and data protection issues that come with communicating data over the internet, is an area where the German IoT industry needs to put more focus.
<p class=""> In my opinion, there is even the possibility for German IoT companies to obtain a leadership position in IoT security, which would further encourage buy-in for IoT technologies from society at large once the benefits and security standards are better understood.”</p>

<p class=""></p>
<p class=""><strong>What about specific to Europe, how does it differ to IoT enterprise in the US?</strong></p>
<p class=""><em>Martin Giess:</em> “Currently, we have a very fragmented IoT market in Europe, this is because different standards are being developed within countries, at a country level, which are often then redundant when applied in other territories. There’s also standards being developed for certain verticals which similarly become redundant when applied to other industries.</p>
<p class="">To drive innovation from Europe, what we need is an open eco-system based on standards and interoperability that enables both large enterprises as well as smaller players and entrepreneurs entering the market, with innovative solutions that serve projects all over the EU.</p>
<p class="">Protocols and data standards that are developed for specific territories or verticals also lock consumers to one vendor. If consumers cannot migrate their data when they replace a device using a different manufacturer, they will in effect lose any benefit from the data they have been accumulating over time. This again creates a closed and fragmented market.”</p>
<p class=""><strong>What’s next for Emnify?</strong></p>
<p class=""><em>Frank Stoecker: </em>EMnify is growing rapidly with new investors and customer coming on board; most <a href="https://www.emnify.com/media-releases/emnify-growing-rapidly-as-new-investor-is-secured/">recently we signed</a> on Lars Singbartl as an investor, the former head of Warburg Pincus Germany. In particular, we’ve seen interest from enterprises and investors increase with our recent launches:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.emnify.com/media-releases/emnify-launches-virtualized-mobile-core-network-for-m2m-connectivity/">EMcore</a> – our virtualized core network</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.emnify.com/media-releases/emnify-launches-first-ever-service-and-connectivity-management-bundle-2/">EMpower</a> – an industry-first connectivity and service management bundle</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.emnify.com/media-releases/emnify-launches-trusted-service-manager-function-advanced-euicc-management/">EMtrust</a> – an industry-first Trusted Service Manager function for the management and provisioning of eUICC SIMs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="">We are also currently in the process of signing major channel partner deals which will commence in the second half of 2016. We will also engage in a new funding round during the second half of 2016. The money sourced in this funding round will mainly be spent to accelerate our global sales and marketing efforts which we initiated in October 2015.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">One of the more interesting products to appear in the IoT space of late is Protonet's ZOE, a smart home hub that's competing with Amazon's Echo for the home market.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You may remember <a href="https://protonetinc.com/">Protonet</a> as the company that broke the internet back in 2014 by crowdfunding <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nsa-proof-server-protonet-smashes-crowdfunding-record-by-raising-1m-89-minutes-1451301"><span class="s3">$1 million in 89 minutes</span></a> and completed the delivery too. The previous project resulted in $4 million raised and set the path for a successful <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/12/free-your-data/"><span class="s2">Free Your Data Campaign</span></a></span><span class="s4">.</span> In 2014, Protonet was awarded the crowdfunding World Champion by Seedmatch, with an investment of USD$3.4 <span class="xn-money">million</span> and was later elected the 2014 startup of the year.</p>
<p class="p2">Protonet is headquartered in <span class="xn-location">Hamburg, Germany</span> and more recently opened offices in the <span class="xn-location">San Francisco</span> Bay area.</p>
<p class="p2">Protonet's point of difference to existing products such as Amazon Echo or Google's Nest cam, is that it extends it's ready made private cloud server technology to home IoT, with ZOE operating outside of the cloud and data centres.</p>
<p class="p2">I spoke to Ali Jelveh, Protonet co-founder and CEO.</p>
<p class="p2">“With the Protonet ZOE, we will bring one of the smartest and most aesthetic Smart Home Hubs to market. Our clear goal is 'The Home of the Free made smart' because people should be able to choose how to live with modern technology, even at home," he said. "We stand for intelligence and data privacy with our products, and have proved that these aspects are compatible.”</p>
<p class="p2">In terms of functionality, The Smart Home Hub understands 1500 voice-commands, learns additional vocabulary with every software-update and syntax-detection of new sentences. All voice-data is stored onto the 2GB encrypted local memory. Protonet ZOE includes “Drops," - small mobile devices which can be placed all over the house so that voice commands can be received in all rooms and on all floors of the house. They can be turned off manually, so that private matters stay private.</p>
&nbsp;

[caption id="attachment_469" align="alignnone" width="1024"]<img class="size-large wp-image-469" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Voicedrop_Kampagne6_whitetable_v03_160318-1024x683.jpg" alt="The small white box featured is a 'drop', capable of receiving voice commands, it's function is to extend the capabillities of ZOE to different areas of the house. " width="1024" height="683" /> <em>The small white box featured is a 'Drop'. Capable of receiving voice commands, its function is to extend the capabilities of ZOE to different areas of the house.</em>[/caption]

<div></div>
<div>
<p class="p2">With the help of these Drops, ZOE understands which room a person is standing in and from which room they are giving their spoken command. As Jelveh explains: "Due to this, I can say from the bedroom 'Hey, ZOE, turn off the lights' and the lights will, in fact, only turn off in my bedroom – even though ZOE is managing my whole house."</p>

</div>
<p class="p2">Interestingly, this new Smart Home Hub does not charge any monthly fees and functions independently of any cloud, which means that it can work without the need of an internet or Wi-Fi connection.</p>

<h2>ZOE learns your smart-home habits</h2>
<p class="p2">Jelveh said that "a smart home only truly becomes smart once it starts to learn, whether recognizing a pattern or learning a new skill." ZOE is powered with 'IFTTT' capabilities, meaning that it is possible to teach Protonet ZOE actions that are subject to certain conditions, such as turning on the sound system when entering the room. With time, Protonet ZOE learns the various behavioral patterns of its owners and coordinates the smart home devices accordingly.</p>
<p class="p2">The product is extendable, thanks to its two USB ports, and speaks the most common programming languages. It supports wireless, Bluetooth, Z-wave, and cloud connected devices.</p>
<p class="p2">The intention is to make it open source - to welcome tinkerers and developers to create more uses for ZOE.</p>
<p class="p2">Jelveh predicts that "we are moving to a digital world, we we have to be conscious of what it means. One of the things about humans is they will connect whatever they can connect. We're going to see the rise of a consciousness movement about what we really want connected."</p>
<p class="p2">"Most smart-home central (units) are nothing more than multifunctional remote controls," he adds. "ZOE, on the other hand, proactively thinks. She recognizes my patterns and acts as a smart assistant upon request. As soon as I leave my house, she proactively reminds me about forgotten devices, open windows or activates my un-activated burglar alarm. On the way home, I can prepare my house for my return at the push of a button."</p>
<p class="p2">Born in Iran, Jelveh moved to France and grew up in Germany.  He notes that the tech scene is Germany is young compared for Silicon Valley, "where you meet veterans who have started three or four companies,' he said. He hopes that their product will shake Silicon Valley of some of its "arrogance" and hopes to empower both consuming choice and privacy.  Will the message be received? We'll have to wait and see.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the agricultural industry through facilitating high precision crop control, useful data collection and automated farming, with an emphasis on water management, waste reduction and cost effectiveness.  Today farms  can leverage IoT to remotely monitor soil moisture, crop growth, smart connected harvesters and irrigation equipment. Then farmers can analyze operational data combined with 3rd party information, such as weather services, to provide new insights and improve decision making.

<strong>TracoVino</strong>

An interesting area where this is occurring is in the business of winemaking. German company <a href="http://www.myomegasys.com/index.php/mynxg/mynxg-iot-architecture">MyOmega</a> has created  the solar powered <span class="goog-text-highlight"> IoT device </span><a href="http://www.myomegasys.com/index.php/new/178-tracovino">TracoVino</a>, with incorporates an  MYNXG controller and corresponding app to support winemakers to improve the quality of their wines, optimize workflows and to monitor vineyards remotely.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-315" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/mobiless.jpg" alt="mobiless" width="1024" height="542" />

&nbsp;

Data is collected via solar powered sensor platforms installed in the vineyard which record the temperature, air and soil humidity levels, sunlight and light intensity. Extra sensors can be installed at any time to measure leaf wetness, soil pH values and nutrient levels. The sensors collected data which they send to the controller. Winemakers are then able to access the data on their smartphones at any time.  Winemakers are able to access forecasts for the condition of the vineyard, potential pest infestation or the expected quality and quantity of the wine at any time, and take suitable action.  The devices are currently being trialled at a four Bavarian vineyards.

&nbsp;

<strong>Rowbot</strong>

<img class="size-full wp-image-318 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/RowbotInRow.jpg" alt="RowbotInRow" width="400" height="602" />

Agricultural innovation is not limited to wine making. Rural start up <a href="http://rowbot.com/">Rowbot</a> has created a team of small robots to help Corn growers.The problem facing many growers is that a rapidly growing crop, mixed with uncertain field conditions, leads to situations where in-season applications of nitrogen cannot be carried out as planned. Constraints and worries linked to crop height keep many growers from using in-season nitrogen management, a widely recognized best practice.The Rowbots work in teams to apply nitrogen fertilizer in sync with corn needs, inter-seed cover-crops into tall corn, and collect data to inform both current and future work.

&nbsp;

<strong>Deepfield Robots</strong>

<a href="http://www.deepfield-robotics.com/">Deepfield Robotics</a>, a start up under Bosch has been working hard in Germany to solve the problems faced by asparagus farmers.

The quality of asparagus depends heavily on the temperature of the ground in which it’s grown. To control the temperature, farmers use a two-sided sheet of foil: the black side draws in sunlight to increase the heat of the asparagus bed, and the white side reflects light to cool the bed down. In order to make the right “black or white” decision, the farmer needs to measure the temperature of every field at least once each evening.  Deepfield explains
<blockquote>That’s where we come in. Our IoT system frequently measures the temperatures of the bed at different levels and stores the data in the cloud. Then we provide this information plus additional analysis in a front-end interface, accessible anywhere, anytime.</blockquote>
In April 2015 they installed ten prototypes in asparagus fields. These prototypes provided just the basic functionality of storing temperatures in the cloud. Using this as a starting point, they worked closely with the farmers to develop their solution further, based on many interviews with these pilot customers, four app updates and continuous back-end improvement.  The result: twelve weeks later at the end of asparagus season, the growth of 225,000 kg of asparagus.

&nbsp;

<strong>Freight Farms</strong>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-320" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/FreightFarmsLeafyGreenMachine.png" alt="Freight+Farms+Leafy+Green+Machine" width="1000" height="693" />

For those situated in urban areas, Freight Farms  takes an innovative approach to farming, growing crops inside repurposed shipping containers, called Leafy Green Machines- literally a freight-truck-sized farm-in-a-box, with all the necessary equipment and storage required to grow produce.

The company takes an innovative approach to farming, growing crops inside repurposed shipping containers, dubbed Leafy Green Machines. It is hoped that the use of an IoT platform will allow for more detailed monitoring of growing conditions in real-time.

By using LogMeIn’s IoT platform<a href="https://xively.com/whats_xively/?mcomb=s7NDde0Q879711957699xivelyei8rbbhb5l0c"> Xively</a>, it enables farmers to assess their crops remotely, tracking features such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels and plant growth. Alerts are delivered whenever any of these metrics fall out of the ideal growing range. The data collected from users also enables Freight Farms to improve their own services, giving them greater insight into how customers are utilising their products. Container gardening is nothing new in urban areas, but it's foreseeable that the water efficient containers could be of benefit to regions where drought causes a barrier to farming.

&nbsp;

<strong>OnFarm</strong>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-321" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/lg_map-903x1024.png" alt="lg_map-903x1024" width="903" height="1024" />

<a href="http://www.onfarm.com/">OnFarm</a> is part of a suite of  IoT technology platforms aimed at the farming industry. OnFarm’s software integrates nearly any type of data from any provider; from real-time soil moisture data to weather data, to image data. Users gain insight and guidance that enables their farming organization to make better more informed decisions resulting in immediate impact on farm inputs such as water, energy, and labor while increasing profitability. OnFarm allows farmers to have one solution to monitor, plan, and to make decisions reducing the friction of adopting and maximizing technology.

It is clear that connected technology and data information is instrumental to the future of farming, particularly in regard to reducing water consumption and feeding the world's population. Sensors, cloud computing and intelligent software all play a part in transforming farming as we know it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The creation of programming languages and platforms is rarely without challenges. A case in point is in the experiences of the community around the Node.js platform. Node.js allows the creation of backend services using JavaScript and a collection of "modules" that handle various core functionality and other core functions. Node.js' modules use an API designed to reduce the complexity of writing server applications. Node.js' package ecosystem, </span><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">npm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.</span>

</div>
There are currently 5 billion connected devices and that will increase tremendously over the next few years. The current and continued need to connect these devices is very important, and many companies - including IBM, Samsung, Intel, and Microsoft - see both APIs as the key to connect these devices and <span class="il">Node</span>.js as the glue that connects them.
<div>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> I spoke with members of Node.js about their experiences in the community, recently at the </span><a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit.</span></a>
<h2>A short Node.js history of the problem</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Node.js emerged in May 2009 and is a child of the git and </span><a href="https://github.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitHub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> era of open source. Its relatively short history offers not only lessons, but also solutions to open source communities dealing with internal conflict for those who function in this new era of development. A few years ago, Node.js had just a few committers (contributors with write access to the repository in order to merge code and triage bugs). Questions were raised about the managing structures and the personalities within. The maintenance overhead for the few committers on Node.js Core was overwhelming and the project began to see a decline in both committers and outside contribution. This resulted in a corresponding decline in releases.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to those invested in the project like James Snell - now IBM's Technical Lead for Node.js and a member of the Node.js core Technical Steering Committee: </span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Developers did not feel empowered to make changes, this drove away developers... the innovation decreased and it became less interesting to invest in the project.”</span></blockquote>
<h2>A change to "open" open source</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to these challenges and corresponding governance conflict, in December 2014, Fedor Indutny started </span><a href="https://iojs.org/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">io.js</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a fork of Node.js. Unlike Node.js, the authors planned to keep io.js up-to-date with the latest releases of the Google V8 JavaScript engine. io.js' point of difference was that it operated using principles consistent with the </span><a href="https://communitywiki.org/DoOcracy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do-ocracy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movement, an organizational structure in which individuals choose roles and tasks for themselves and execute them. Responsibilities attach to people who </span><b>do</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the work, rather than elected or selected officials. Snell revealed that</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">"By liberalizing the contribution process we stabilized the platform more." He went on to explain that contributions by community members to the code, community or documentation defined those involved in decision making as "everyone who pushes a request had an equal seat at the table."</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first few months io.js attracted more active developers than the node.js project has had in its entire history.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In February 2015, the intent to form a neutral Node.js Foundation was announced. By June 2015, the Node.js and io.js communities voted to work together under the Node.js Foundation. Node.js v0.12 and io.js v3.3 were merged back together into Node v4.0. This brought V8 features into Node.js, and a long-term support release cycle.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<h2> A new way forward</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Node.js Foundation governance was divided into two entities with equal standing: A Business Board  - responsible for business, marketing and legal direction - and a Technical Steering Committee - responsible for code development, testing, integration, and working groups and projects. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Snell explained that:</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Having a governance structure enabled decision making clarity and essentially resolved personality issues."</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> This also left room for developer-driver innovation as Snell commented, </span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Our road map is whatever developers and contributors want to do and is reflected in the commit history."</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-583" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-04-11-at-11.09.36.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-11 at 11.09.36" width="749" height="440" /> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Node.js project is divided into many components with a full organizational size of well over 400 members. Node.js Core now has over 50 committers and over 100 contributors per month. </span><a href="http://mikealrogers.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mikeal Rogers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, now community manager of the Node.js Foundation, explained that this innovation has extended into other areas of the foundation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"We've just started doing analytics around who are our modern open source developers. We've trying to cater to more casual users and on how to convert users into participants. People don't want to be passive consumers and we've trying to remove the barriers to participation."</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Foundation’s </span><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/foundation/tsc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Steering Committee (TSC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oversees a range of committees including the Inclusivity Working Group. They've introduced practical ways to be inclusive like a policy for timezones requiring "pull requests should sit for at least 36 hours to ensure that contributors in other timezones have time to review," Rogers said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"As projects mature, there’s a tendency to become top heavy and overly hierarchical as a means of quality control and this is enforced through process," he added. "We use process to add transparency that encourages participation, which grows the code review pool which leads to better quality control. More people means more reviews and more checks and balances. We also break core groups into working groups to avoid being top heavy."</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a growing community of not only the interested but also the committed, Node.js demonstrates that liberalizing contributions and participatory governance will be the future of open source development and as they continue to scale, they'll create a legacy that future communities will strive to follow.</span></span>

		<title>Can startup Suggestic tackle Type 2 diabetes?</title>
		<link>https://readwrite.com/2016/04/09/machine-learning-type-2-diabetes-pt4/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><a href="http://suggestic.com/">Suggestic</a> is a digital startup trying to tackle <a href="https://readwrite.com/2015/02/10/apple-watch-dexcom-app-diabetes-glucose-monitoring/">Type 2 diabetes</a> using machine learning to create personalized interventions and guide users through them towards disease reversal.  </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The founders have created a "lifestyle GPS" app that works as a personal assistant to help people with Type 2 diabetes navigate towards a healthier lifestyle by providing contextual suggestions related to nutrition, physical activity, exercise, sleep and stress management. </span>Focusing on the concept of precision medicine - targeted treatment based on an individual’s gene, environment and lifestyle - it employs machine learning technology to extract and validate causal patterns between each person’s genes, metabolism, diet and psychology.</p>
<p class="p2">I spoke to Shai Rosen, CMO and founder, who explained that the impetus for Suggestic came from personal experience, with himself and another founder having lost family members due to complications caused by Type 2 diabetes and two of their team being diagnosed pre-diabetic (now reserved). Shai detailed the need in healthcare to view the person beyond their medical self</p>
<p class="p2">"We need to really  understand who is the person and what is the right intervention for them…. to see the patient as not only a biological being but also psychological self which changes in different contexts. To really do this, we need machine learning," Rosen said.</p>
<p class="p2">By adapting machine-learning models, Suggestic culls and analyzes correlated patterns between the user’s genes, diet and metabolism, then generates personalized recommendations to reverse the diabetes.</p>
<p class="p2">"Adequate control can lead in many cases to the reversal of symptoms and biomarkers enabling persons with diabetes to lead an almost normal life," Shai explains. "That is the reversal we are aiming for by helping them change and maintain the healthiest lifestyle for each individual."</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nBJN7DH83HA" width="707" height="707" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h2>Suggestic augments existing care</h2>
<p class="p2">Users will download Suggestic’s app and receive baseline dietary and exercise advice for diabetics. From there “you add layers of personalization,” Shai says, from age and weight to lab results and known blood-sugar triggers, <span class="s1">stressing that their role was not to replace that of health professionals, but rather to extend or augment their work, particularly in the area of better adherence to treatment and improved care. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Suggestic is still in early stages of testing, having only recently moved from a  closed alpha phase to closed beta phase. They currently have a waiting list of over 1,000 people wanting to access their platform, which will be offered free to health consumers.</p>
<p class="p2">There's also plans to incorporate components of their platform into employee wellness plans with the goal to produce reduced absenteeism and enhanced productivity at work and fewer doctor visits. "I always thought mainstream users would be the drivers, but we have also been approached by big health organizations and pharmaceutical companies," Shai admits. "We’ve been impressed at how open the medical industry has been to use AI and talk about personalization, particularly when it comes to  lifestyle and treatment compliance."</p>
<p class="p2">Suggestic is constantly crunching data and with an emphasis on evidence based medicine and is backed by a board of health professionals, geneticists and machine learning academics. They have a team of  investors that Shai considers "patient and really understanding of the time this kind of work takes. We will not hurry our process beyond what makes sense just to please an investor."</p>

The crossroads between machine learning and personalized healthcare is definitely something that will become an important part of medicine, and it will be interesting to see the outcomes of later trials by Suggestic as they work to improve the prognosis for those afflicted by diabetes.

		<title>Adidas wants to be the coolest gym teacher ever</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week sportswear maker adidas debuted a new wearable device, co-developed with <a href="https://ihtusa.com/">Interactive Health Technologies</a> (IHT). Called the adidas ZONE for IHT Spirit, it's the first wrist-based wearable device developed specifically for physical education class use.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Currently, IHT supports 1,500 teachers in 800 schools across the country and during the 2015 school year, 600,000 children were connected to the IHT Spirit System. With the help of the new wearable, IHT is on track to hit their 2016 target of interacting with one million students nationwide on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="size-full wp-image-544 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/charger-6.jpg" alt="charger-6" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ZONE is a wrist-worn, heart rate monitoring device that integrates into the existing IHT Spirit System - a cloud-based curriculum for physical education (PE) - that allows teachers to efficiently track each student’s performance in PE class, creating individualized workouts and goals for students based on their personal fitness levels. The product is built to meet the needs of teachers across the country, durable enough for multiple students to wear during PE classes, and can sync quickly, using NFC technology. Heart rate training is accompanied by pedometer data, IHT's PE 3 project-based curriculum, and the adidas Challenges program which uses cloud-based software</span></p>
Stacey Burr, VP and general manager of adidas Digital Sports said that "in working with IHT, we found a partner that shared our vision of inspiring the next generation to lead healthy lives by making sport and fitness a life-long pursuit. We’re firm believers that healthy habits are easier to keep the earlier you start, so introducing tools and resources at the school-level offered the perfect place to lay such an important foundation.“
<h2>Adidas can boost kids' performance...if they still have PE classes</h2>
It's unclear how the program will help those subject to the alarming trend of PE classes being reduced or eliminated from school curriculums across the US that adidas aims to address. It is, after all, likely that the wearable and curriculum will be more readily adopted by school already invested in sports than those without resources or funding.

I also can't help wondering about the privacy of the data, as adidas asks you to "imagine 12 years from today, when your 1st graders receive their high school diploma and along with it, are handed their entire wellness portfolio correlated to their academic, attendance and fitness success. A legacy created for students and their families while meeting the daily needs of school administration and compliance."  Would such data be attached to college and job applications of the future? What are the consequences for future health insurance?

<span class="s1">It's also worthy considering that unless a lifetime warranty is available - that's unclear at this stage - a device targeting K-12 students is likely to require repeat purchases. The device retails at $139, and is also available for schools to buy for students in PE through <a href="https://ihtusa.com/zone-pricing/">package pricing</a>. </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2015, <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/en-US/Pages/NewHomePage1.aspx">Dimension Data</a> became the official technology partner for the<b> </b><a href="http://www.letour.fr/le-tour/2014/us/">Tour de France</a>, the world’s largest and most prestigious cycling race. In support of their goal to revolutionize the viewing experience of billions of cycling fans across the globe, Dimension Data needed to analyze thousands of data points per second, from nearly 200 riders, across 21 gruelling days of cycling.

They chose to partner with IBM and leverage their streaming analytics platform, InfoSphere Streams. The joint team developed a winning solution that provides advanced analysis of rider data, calculating dynamic race position ranking and grouping of riders.

What changed things was putting GPS sensors on every bicycle and installing a sophisticated relay system that transmitted data to central servers, and then to apps, Web sites and broadcasters. The racers and their bikes were data-collection points on the Internet of Things. The goal was nothing less than transforming the Tour fan experience.

One of the key ingredients in this setup was IBM Streams technology, which gathers data from many sources in real time and organizes it so insights can be drawn from it. In the future, thanks to a new but related IBM technology, Quarks, cycling fans, broadcasters and team strategists could gain much deeper insights during the Tour.

<a href="http://quarks-edge.github.io/">Quarks</a> is an open source project that makes it makes it easier for developers to create IoT applications to analyze data on the edge of their networks.

I spoke to Chris Howard, Big Data Technical Leader at IBM Asia Pacific, and Nagui Halim, IBM Fellow, about the collaboration.

<strong><strong>RW: </strong>What lead to the collaboration with Dimension Data?</strong>

<em>Chris:</em> Dimension Data actually won the partnership rights with Amaury Sports Organization (ASO), the company that own the Tour de France, to provide their technology and their analytics platform for the next five years. Really, what they were looking to do was revolutionize the viewing experience for spectators of the Tour de France and really bring it into the 21st century - or even into the 22nd century. And the reason for doing that is that if you look at the way data is both captured, processed and analyzed historically with the Tour de France it's extremely manual.

It literally relied on people with stopwatches and radios and timing boards radioing back to base about which particular rider has passed which particular milestone. It was very, very cumbersome and quite old-worldly in nature. And looking at how do they group the riders, so if you look at the pack of riders that may spread out over 30 kilometers or more over 5 or 6 hours of the race, how they group the riders was also manual, it was somebody literally hanging off the back of a motorcycle or sticking their head out of the sunroof of a chase vehicle and someone would (check) the race numbers on the shirts and say "Well, there's 15 people on that group, there are 12 people in that group, oh, and one of them’s just changed groups."

That would be radioed back and the graphics team would then produce all of their updates and that would then get spread out for updates. So, if you were unlucky enough not to be part of one of those groups, as a rider, there's no real visibility of who you are and where you are - from a television standpoint, you may as well not exist and no one would know you were even part of the Tour De France or what progress you were making at this stage.

In March last year, we began investigating how we could use IBM's Streams to analyze a lot of this data, given that they were looking to essentially instrumentalize every single bicycle. Every bike would be intrumented with a GPS receiver which had to ability to relay to a local motorbike or race vehicle that would then manage the signal up to an aircraft and the signal would end up being a mobile data sensor that was stop at the finish line so you could then use that data to do interesting things.

<strong><strong>RW</strong>: What did the data mean in a practical sense?</strong>

<em>Chris:</em> For ever single rider - and last year we had 198 riders - we were getting a positional fix every second, the latitude and longitude and the speed of every single rider. And from that raw data, we then did lots of things to determine their journey so far, how far they’d progressed, the ranking of the riders, the distance and times between all of the riders. Automatically grouping the riders into the constituent parts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloton">peloton</a> and then being able to push that data out to a website for consumption by spectators and also broadcast purposes. All had to be done quite quickly - in many cases, a couple of seconds at a maximum. So Stream's solution was working on a sub-second time slot that we were allocated to do all of the analysis and then the arrival of that data and get that data out.

A back story to the Tour de France - and that had really not been seen before - began to emerge in terms of the profit and progress of the riders and starting to understand the way in which gaps evolve, how the group handles itself, how the peloton shapes itself and what happens when riders slow down to collect their feed bags and what does that do to the average race speed.

There was one particular event where there was a very large crash and it shows the average speed of all the riders very quickly drops off to zero as the riders all hit the tarmac. In terms of involvement, most of the teams took up the opportunity to deliver a white label version of the data, so you could go to their team website and see the visualization process and a comparison between their team members all the rest of the riders.

<strong>RW: The Tour de France has been happening for such a long time, why has it taken so long to get this kind of data system? Is it because of the cycling industry or a lag in technology?</strong>

<em>Chris: </em>There are a number of factors. ASO owns the tour but not the teams or the riders, so I think there’s probably some political resistance to having people instrumented and starting to reveal details about location and so on. And I think if they move forward with things like power output data, cycling cadence, pedalling cadence, respiration, heart rate, that's quite sensitive and certainly could be used in a competitive nature so you’d have to be careful as to how that data was shared.

<em>Nagui:</em> In a nefarious sense, you could probably determine if there’s doping going on due to anomalies to normal behavior.

<strong>RW: Aren’t the riders utilizing wearables already?</strong>

<em>Chris:</em> They do, they have a head unit on the bike for capturing data for retrospective analysis, and certainly having access to the real time data for a team director would be hugely relevant and very useful. The other challenge is we can’t do this through Wi-Fi, cellular coverage is often very spotty up in the mountains, and there's the task of backhauling this data - getting it to the point where you’ve got consistency in delivery and maximizing the availability of the signal. There's literally a fleet of vehicles - bikes, cars, planes, helicopters - that follow the Tour and deliver everything from broadcasts to food. It's challenging to get access to the data.

(As for Quarks) We believe that starting to provide some edge processing adds a whole new dimension again, and so looking at the terrain, the way the data is captured - cyclists going through tunnels, going down extremely steep gradients being able to do things like capture the data and do a store-and-forward model where we can do virtual updates to fill in any gaps in the data that might have occurred because of terrain.

We do a lot of inferring from the data to determine whats actually happening out on the road, what does this location speed actually represent, and as we view multiple riders, we can look at some of the interesting patterns that comes from combining the data. Most devices on the back of the bike include accelerometers, gyroscopes and pressure sensors, and therefore if you find from your gyroscope that the bicycle is upside down, you can determine if it was a gradual decrease, maybe the rider had a puncture....and if it was a sudden decrease, perhaps a crash. Local events might involve an alert that is sent back up to the data centre to allow stream reporting

<strong><strong>RW</strong>: Any there any specific things learned from last year's efforts?</strong>

<em>Chris</em>: There's an awful lot more that you can start to understand about the race as it unfolds, and the ability to compare individual riders and against prior performance means we can start to infer things like the gradient of ascent, from one particular state of a course, and looking at where they may be similar elsewhere and we start to use that for predictive purpose. We also gained an understanding in what might be interesting to spectators, how can we deliver a compelling viewers experience - how to we enhance that with more advanced analytics - to gain more excitement.

<strong><strong>RW: </strong> Is there applicability in other areas?</strong>

<em>Nagui</em>: We've been approached by different industries, including horse racing and also the <a href="http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/">Indianapolis Motor Speedway</a>. Conversely, we offer similar depths of data in monitoring patients with the treatment of their diabetes. Quark is applicable in so many different spaces.

		<title>Can Halo Sport change our brain efficiency?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the era of <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">the quantified self </a> we are able to use a range of trackers and monitors within the Internet of Things (IoT) to assess and monitor our health throughout each day and night. But a small suite of companies like <a href="http://www.thync.com/">Thync</a> and <a href="http://www.fisherwallace.com/?gclid=CPyOvdWMjswCFbgy0wodsS4AUg">Fisher Wallace Laboratories</a> have extended this reach to the use of  wearables to transform the capabilities of the brain to manage conditions like mild fatigue, depression and insomnia.
<div>

The latest device comes from <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/">Halo Neuro</a>, a headset called Halo Sport, targeting athletes that resembles headphones and uses what it calls <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/">neuro-priming</a> - another term for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation">transcranial direct current stimulation</a> which involves the use of electrical pulses to encourage the brain to form new pathways to increase performance. It's an approach that comes deeply steeped in <a href="https://halo-website-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/whitepapers/mvc.pdf">scientific</a> <a href="https://halo-website-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/whitepapers/mvc.pdf">research</a>. Halo Neuro consists of a team of 20 with impressive credentials, half of which are engineers, the rest doctors and neuroscientists.

I recently spoke to Halo’s co-founder and CEO, Dr. Daniel Chao, about how Halo Sport works and the impetus for the latest wearable.

He explained some of their background research around neuro-priming which involved double-blind, controlled experiments with 1,000 people to determine efficacy and safety:
<blockquote>
<div>"A lot of people ask us how we got to the athletic market, certainly not an obvious place for a bunch of neuroscientists to fall into, it was really the data that led us there. In our first year of operation we didn't think about products or markets, our goal was to generate data from the thousand people and to really let to data drive us to our first market and our first product.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We were informed by the published literature and our own results regarding the stimulation of the motor cortex. Only after generating the data did we start to think who would be interested in a motor cortex stimulator. The motor cortex controls movement so the natural affinity was athletes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We starting collaborating with different athletic organizations to test our systems in their population of people, firstly college students and then taking it up the chain to professional Olympic athlete level. We continued to see results at that level."</div></blockquote>
<h2>Halo Sport brings results for U.S. ski team</h2>
The results are impressive. On average Halo is shown to increase learning by 50% and overall performance by 10%. The United States Olympic Ski &amp; Snowboard association used Halo and saw a 1.7X increase in performance with their athletes.
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uW-ltuS6rXg" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Pro athletes everywhere from the <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/04/06/nfl-found-iot-vl2/">NFL</a>'s combine to MLB teams are using Halo to improve their game. Halo released a limited run of their consumer headsets shipping this fall and they are gearing up to announce a general availability preorder date this fall.

</div>
In the first instance the pool of elite athletes seem an odd focus, given the size of the pool - particularly as Chao's previous business, <a href="http://www.neuropace.com/">NeuroPace</a>, developed an FDA-approved implantable brain stimulator for epilepsy.

Dr. Chao explained that the minutiae of improvement in elite sports is why they were the perfect people:
<blockquote>
<div>"In elite athletes, 1-2% improvement is huge.  For example, we've been doing some work with the US Ski Team. I  was invited to do the World Championships and noticed that with any of these sports at the highest level,  the difference between 1st and 2nd place  - let alone 20th - is just a sliver".</div></blockquote>
However Neuro Sport is not limited to athletes in their prime but can have benefits to even the amateur or enthusiastic athlete. I was curious to see if Dr. Chao had tested the headset on himself:
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<div>"I’ve used it probably 100 times. I’m an avid cyclist, and in my mid 40s, my personal record is very difficult to beat. These days it's more about treading water than improving.  There's a hill north of San Francisco that is notorious for cycling enthusiasts and I beat my personal best by 15 seconds doing a fairly focused training plan. I was really proud of that."</div>
<div></div></blockquote>
Halo is already working with some of the nation’s top hospitals on researching the use of their technology to accelerate the rate of recovery in stroke patients. The U.S. Military has accelerated pilot and sniper training by 50% with neurotechnology similar to Halo Sport. Further down the road, Halo plans to release a model to improve memory and hopefully aid Alzheimer's patients.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How IoT&#039;s Buddy could help solve Flint&#039;s water crisis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><a href="https://buddy.com/">Buddy</a> has a goal, to use IoT for the greater good. They've created a water quality demo that showcases how Buddy integrates with distributed devices and sensors as part of an initiative they are setting up called <em>IoT for Impact</em>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The result is quality, real-time data, that could be used to preemptively alert health officials of system abnormalities - like those that impacted Flint, Michigan, recently - that could then be addressed immediately.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I spoke to CEO and co-founder David McLauchlan, about the initiative. He explained:</div>
<blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>To some, IoT data is seen as superfluous.  Events with disastrous impact are surfacing all around us and coming to a head. The contaminated drinking water in Flint, poisoned water from fracking in New York and Pennsylvania, continued <em>e. coli</em> and listeria break outs in Massachusetts, or air quality issues in Oregon — these problems could have been predicted or in some way contained if IoT technology had been implemented.</div></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>If sensors were placed in common water filters used in homes, the Flint water crisis could have been discovered and remediated. This could extend to solve other environmental problems, for example:</div>

<div>

The Buddy demo uses water turbidity as a proxy for the overall water quality.  A variety of other water quality characteristics could be measured using this same design.  In their demo, data is captured from a turbidity sensor and displayed real-time on a dashboard.  If the turbidity level crosses a certain threshold (for example, 100 NTU), the sensor alerts by changing the color of smart lightbulbs in two separate locations.

The demo can be broken down into the following key steps:
<ol>
	<li>Turbidity sensor is placed in water sample</li>
	<li>Data is collected, processed, and streamed real-time to Splunk</li>
	<li>As the sensor detects key thresholds, light bulbs change color indicating a threshold was met</li>
	<li>Data is compared against a data-set of water quality data provided by USGS</li>
</ol>

<h2>Flint and other cities need help from all sectors</h2>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">McLaughlan admits that none of this is easy.  </span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Sensor and beacon developers must work with product manufacturers to enable easy, low-cost data generation and transmission. Data collection, aggregation and processing platforms must be able to ingest the data, connect it to advanced software tools and make it accessible for in-depth analyses. And public agencies, policymakers, advocacy groups and scientific organizations must leverage the data in ways that increase our collective ability to prevent or minimize social crises.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">This type of information supply chain can’t happen in a vacuum. It can’t be achieved through closed-door meetings, and it can’t be contained in a lab. It requires widespread participation and collaboration, but the incentives are clear. <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/04/08/iiot-strengthens-investment-outlook-morgan-stanley-if4/">Businesses can profit.</a> Public agencies can reduce the human and financial cost of health crises. And individuals can play a greater role in their own safety and well-being.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p7">It will be exciting to follow up on <em>IoT for Impact</em> and the goal to create an <span class="s1">information supply chain that would help confront—and in many cases prevent—human emergencies.</span></p>

		<title>Are Robots Replacing Humans In Customer Care?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You may have heard the news lately from Guangzhou, China about <a href="http://shanghaiist.com/2016/04/06/restaurant_fires_incompetent_robot_staff.php">the firing of robots as waitstaff</a>. Out of three restaurants that used robots to serve customers, two have closed and the third fired its robot workers. The reasons? The robots couldn't effectively handle soup dishes, often malfunctioned, and had to follow a fixed route that sometimes resulted in clashes. A customer also claimed that robots were unable to do tasks such as topping up water or placing a dish on the table.

<img class=" wp-image-912 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/robot-waiter-guangzhou-1.jpg" alt="robot-waiter-guangzhou-1" width="657" height="437" />
<blockquote>"The robots weren't able to carry soup or other food steady and they would frequently break down. The boss has decided never to use them again," said one employee.</blockquote>
The robots were priced at around $8,000, not including electricity and repairs, making them cheaper than human staff. But except for the novelty value, it was a somewhat failed experiment.

However, robots are being used increasingly in customer support and care in a range of capacities. While there are none operating with complete autonomy, there are plenty of examples where robots have a functional purpose which they are successfully delivering.
<h2>You'll find robots in customer service roles now</h2>
You're no doubt familiar with <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/03/10/pepper-robot-helper/">Pepper Robots</a>, who partake a range of tasks including helping people at train stations in France, providing information and direction on trains. In Spain and France, they work in department stores, highlighting products and providing directions.

<img class="size-full wp-image-926 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/12184001_618711521603081_6090011780322471051_o.jpg" alt="12184001_618711521603081_6090011780322471051_o" width="720" height="479" />

You may have seen Japan's <a href="http://www.h-n-h.jp/en/">Henn na Hotel</a> that is staffed largely by robots in both front desk and customer service tasks. But it's not merely a one-off. Robotics company <a href="http://www.savioke.com/">Savioke </a>have created a robot called Relay for hotel delivery service. It can navigate autonomously, ride the elevator by itself, and carry items such as toothbrushes, towels, and snacks to guest rooms. It's currently employed successfully in several US hotels. The robot - which uses Wi-Fi and 3D cameras to navigate around the hotel - doesn't have arms, so it has to rely on its display screen to communicate with guests.

<img class="size-full wp-image-919 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Robot-Mario-test-een-biertje-ht-1.jpg" alt="Robot-Mario-test-een-biertje-ht (1)" width="710" height="430" />

In Belgium, <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/gnemc-ghent-marriott-hotel/" target="_blank">The Marriott Hotel Ghent</a> employs "Mario" - designed to provide an extra level of client experience. Mario is deployed in the MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conventions, Exhibitions) market for a welcome or farewell speech. Like many corporate mid-level execs, he also gives classic PowerPoint presentations. Mario sprung from the collection of Nao robots created by <a href="https://www.aldebaran.com/en">Aldebaran</a> - the team behind Pepper, too.

Aldebaran's Nao family of robots are also utilized at Hilton McLean in Virginia where<a href="https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49307.wss"> "Connie</a>,"  the first Watson-enabled robot concierge in the hospitality industry is employed.  Connie draws on domain knowledge from Watson and WayBlazer to inform guests on local tourist attractions, dining recommendations and hotel features and amenities. Using a combination of Watson APIs, including Dialog, Speech to Text, Text to Speech and Natural Language Classifier, Connie greets guests upon arrival and answers questions about hotel amenities, services and hours of operation.
<h2>Kids loves robots while in hospital</h2>
Nao robots also have more serious  functions to serve. In Canada, they come in the form of <a href="http://www.rxrobots.com/medi-kits.html">MEDi</a>, employed at the <a href="http://www.childrenshospital.ab.ca/site/PageNavigator/news_events/Medirobot.html">Alberta Children's Hospital.</a> The robots are are specifically programmed with sets of behaviors that match the steps of a medical procedure, providing pain management support during medical procedures.

&nbsp;

<img class="size-full wp-image-911 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/medi.jpg" alt="medi" width="620" height="348" />

&nbsp;

A study at the hospital involving 57 children between the ages of four and nine found the robots helped ease fears when children came in for flu shots. According to Tanya Beran, a professor of Community Health Sciences at the University of Calgary who helped program the robots, she says among those kids who interacted with the robot, the hospital reduced children's pain and anxiety by half. MEDi is programmed to interact with kids for a wide range of procedures, starting with flu vaccines and blood draws and since expanding to include IV and catheter removal and brain-activity tests. Beran says they're looking to add cast-cutting to MEDi's skills soon.

<img class="size-full wp-image-915 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/6256240-3x2-700x467.jpg" alt="6256240-3x2-700x467" width="700" height="467" />

The use of robots in aged-care is also on the rise. Often a poorly paid, thus understaffed, sector, it's not unreasonable to see a future where basic work and support tasks will be performed by robots or people assisted by robots or exoskeletons.

<a href="http://rtc.nagoya.riken.jp/RIBA/index-e.html">RIBA</a> in Japan is the first robot that can lift up or set down a real human from or to a bed or wheelchair. RIBA does this using its very strong human-like arms and by novel tactile guidance methods using high-accuracy tactile sensors. RIBA was developed by integrating RIKEN's control, sensor, and information processing and TRI's material and structural design technologies.

Robots in hospitals also have a part of play in germ prevention. <a href="http://www.xenex.com/">Xenex</a> "germ zapping robots" are currently operational in a series of hospitals and aged care facilities in the US. The Xenex robot uses pulsed xenon to create broad spectrum, high intensity light covering the entire germicidal spectrum. The light quickly destroys harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi and bacterial spores on surfaces inside the facility.
<h2>What's next for robots?</h2>
Clearly the advent of machine learning means that robots are getting smarter. There's also greater efforts to make robots more lifelike; This month saw the release of Jia Jia, developed at the University of Science and Technology of China, a human-looking robot which can speak, show micro-expressions, move its lips, and move its body.

<img class=" wp-image-928 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/tumblr_nyq6wiEzCQ1u8cizpo1_1280-1024x683.jpg" alt="tumblr_nyq6wiEzCQ1u8cizpo1_1280" width="754" height="503" />

The robot is not dissimilar in appearance to Chihira Junco, <a href="http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2015_10/tp1901.htm">a robot released last year by Toshiba</a>, employed as a greeter at a waterpark and public events. Junko speaks Japanese, English and Chinese and incorporates Toshiba’s speech synthesis technology.

Perhaps the most interesting robot I've seen of late comes from <a href="http://www.bostondynamics.com/index.html">Boston Dynamics</a>, who you may recall bought us the <a href="http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_bigdog.html">big dog robot</a>. "Atlas, The Next Generation" is designed to operate outdoors and inside buildings. It is specialized for mobile manipulation, and electrically powered and hydraulically actuated. It uses sensors in its body and legs to balance and LIDAR and stereo sensors in its head to avoid obstacles, assess the terrain, help with navigation and manipulate objects. This version of Atlas is about 5' 9" tall  - about a head shorter than the DRC Atlas - and weighs 180 lbs. It's not pretty enough to be functional in customer care but it sets an interesting - if a little sinister - look into robots of the future.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's a tech party and IoT is everywhere right now - loud, noisy and on the dance floor with a tie around its head.

With so much energy in being devoted to tell us how, when, where, what we can connect to each other, the "why" may be getting a little blurry. So we want to take a step back every now and take a critical look at the connected devices that actually go out and buy, right now.

<em>(Ed note: We also do a <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/04/24/crowdfunding-iot-projects-watch-week-dl1/">round-up of crowdfunding</a> ideas you can't quite get yet...or possibly should never be able to get.)</em>

Here's what caught our eye, for all the right - or wrong - reasons:
<h2>The Best of.....</h2>
<em><strong>Bios incube</strong></em>

<img class=" wp-image-1150 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/0f4245e19921e69368b724cf6d090a10_original.jpg" alt="0f4245e19921e69368b724cf6d090a10_original" width="502" height="281" />

Whatever your views on the existence of the afterlife, reality is that cemetery space is becoming a crowded, expensive, commodity. The alternative cremation results in the question of how to deal with the ashes, with the options not  all that appealing, especially if you've already been to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4ezPvzKe5M">scattering of ashes where the wind blew them back in the faces of the bereaved.</a>

Now there's another option thanks to Bios Incube, a biodegradable urn containing a tree seed in which you can place the ashes and monitor remotely. According to the manufacturers, "the urn provides proper germination and later growth of the tree, based on a person or pet’s ashes. In this way, death becomes a transformation and return to life by means of nature". The Bios Incube is a step up the from the creators earlier device of simply a seed and a biodegradable urn, and it is designed to  facilitate growth, and enables you to track and monitor your Bios Urn. A corresponding mobile app tells you how your tree is growing, and when necessary, provide advice for maintenance...because surely there'd be nothing worse than planting a loved one's ashes with a growing tree only to have it die on you, too?

&nbsp;

<em><strong>Cloud: Smart</strong></em>

<img class=" wp-image-1407 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/4-11.jpg" alt="4-11" width="549" height="549" />

<em><a href="http://www.richardclarkson.com/shop/cloud">The Cloud</a></em> is "an interactive speaker/lamp designed to mimic a thunderstorm in both sound and light. Functions include: streaming music via Bluetooth, music visualization, motion sensing &amp; creating ambient light displays." Think of it as a self-indulgent piece of interactive art. That makes the $3,360 price tag more palatable.

&nbsp;

<em><strong>Nora</strong></em>

<img class=" wp-image-1419 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Kickstarter-page-Embedded_7-03_grande.jpg" alt="Kickstarter-page-Embedded_7-03_grande" width="501" height="461" />

When you're from a family of chronic snorers and you've all spent time in sleep clinics to no avail, a product that not only aims to prevent snoring  but is also backed by sleep scientists is very appealing. <a href="http://www.smartnora.com/">Nora</a> is a wireless device that detects the early sounds of snoring then gently moves your head by activating a padded insert in your pillow case. The insert is inflated and the movement treats the cause of snoring, the relaxed throat muscles, allowing the airway to clear and the breathing to continue. The $259 price is far cheaper than renting an apartment with a spare bedroom.
<h2>...and the worst</h2>
<em><strong>Peggy</strong></em>

<img class="wp-image-1148 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/peggy-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="549" height="366" />

<a href="https://www.omo.com.au/peggy/">Peggy</a> is a smart clothes peg bought to you by detergent-maker Omo. It measures temperature and humidity with a corresponding app that helps you decide when you dry your clothes outside. Note to Peggy users: Go outside. Just for a while. You probably won't die.

<em><strong>Juicero</strong></em>

<img class=" wp-image-1149 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/juicero_image.png" alt="juicero_image" width="603" height="363" />

Cold-pressed juice has become smart thanks to <a href="https://www.juicero.com/">Juicero</a>. Juicing is no longer about chopping up some fresh fruit and extracting the juice. Instead you have to buynot only the juicer but also a subscription to space age-like single serve packages of diced fruit and vegetables which when added to the machine will give you one glass of juice. Where does the IoT come in? According to the website:
<blockquote>"Connectivity is a key component of the Juicero system. Being connected to the internet ensures that you have the latest updates and that your Press is operating optimally. Once everything is synced, you’ll be able to rely on the app to see which Packs you’ve consumed and which ones still remain. To ensure you’re drinking the highest quality juice, the app will also notify you when Packs are about to expire." In case that's not enough to tempt you, "you’ll always know which nutrients you’re consuming and which farm grew each ingredient."

&nbsp;</blockquote>
At $700 for the juicer and  the requisite juice packs at $5 each, the local artisan bio-cafe is looking a lot more accessible. When did cutting an orange in half become too hard?

<em><strong>The Control Freak</strong></em>

<img class="size-full wp-image-1151 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/ControlFreak_2nd_grande.jpg" alt="ControlFreak_2nd_grande" width="600" height="600" />

The mere name of this product makes me think of A-type personalities who use their kitchen more for storing take-out sushi chopsticks than actual food prep. Yes, <a href="http://polyscienceculinary.com/products/the-control-freak">The Control Freak</a> is actually the name of this stove top, a collaboration between Breville and Polyscience, who assert:
<blockquote>"It's the first of its kind to accurately measure, set and hold 397 cooking temperatures from 86°-482°F. The unique real-time sensing system uses a through-glass sensor to directly measure surface temperature. Probe Control™ remote thermometer to precisely control the temperature of both water and fat-based liquids."</blockquote>
Once you've seen the magic you can do with an old battered wok over a flame, the price of $1,799.95 is laughable. Perhaps learning to cook with the stuff in your kitchen already is a better start.

		<title>The Internet of Packaging? Meet Magic Add</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Consider the number of the packaged products in the world, and that the possibility that each could be interactive either within the supply chain as part of the manufacturing process or as a retail product that interacts with the retailer and/or consumer.

All of a sudden the size of the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes unimaginably big and adding way more packages as well. And right now, UPS and FedEx still leave you a ratty Post-It Note to let you know they missed you.

Enter Finland's <a href="http://www.magicadd.com/">Magic Add</a> - they enable packages to communicate with people. Readwrite spoke with CEO Samuli Manninen about the company.

Magic Add started off in 2011 with the idea of creating a self-cooling soda cans, intending to include add a "digital experience" such as a QR code for marketing purposes to off set the price of the can.  The soda cans didn't take off due to the need for further technological advancement, but an interest in smart packaging remained. Today Magic Add utilitizes coding and sensor technology to enable everyday packaging to communicate.

An example is their collaboration with packaging giant <a href="http://www.huhtamaki.com/">Huhtamaki</a> to include a label on their hot beverage cups, printed with a unique technology to connect the packaging with digital content. The coffee cups were distributed amongst Finland's ABC service stations. Once the customer purchased a beverage then connected the code to the Internet via their mobile, they were rewarded with two months of free usage of Nelonen Media’s <a href="http://www.ruutu.fi/plus">Ruutu+</a> on-demand video service.

This enabled customers can see episodes from the highly popular <a href="http://www.nelonen.fi/ohjelmat/vain-elamaa">Vain Elämää </a> (Just Life) series in advance before it aired on TV.  The result: a new means for Nelonen Media to reach out to more customers and make their Ruutu+ -service more known and used in Finland. At the same time the concept will make ABC’s coffee cups more appealing for consumers.

<img class=" wp-image-1393 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/IoP-262x300.jpg" alt="packaging" width="269" height="308" />

QR codes are something that never really took off globally - for example, they are big in Southeast Asia but something of a failure in Australia - something Manninen attributes to a lack of consideration by retailers and marketers about the content behind the code. He notes that the codes often led to poorly constructed websites offering little to consumers - making the problem not the technology but the content.

Magic Add's growth area is really within the supply chain process of packaged goods where coding can be unique to each product and highly scalable. As Manninen explains:
<blockquote>"The idea is that use the same unique and dynamic code in the logistic chain and then when it moves to the consumers it changes to consumer marketing."</blockquote>
<p class="Leipis-musta">Tracking capability provides cost-saving opportunities for  logistics chains in industries with critical environmental aspects. Magic Add technology provides a capability to ensure that certain temperature or other environmental factors have not exceeded acceptable limits. Even time can be tracked, when a monitored factor has violated a certain specification.</p>

<h2>Smart packaging means less waste, better dinners</h2>
Food packages embedded with unique codes can mean a reduction in food waste, as it tells consumers food expiry dates and could also alert them to special deals. It also makes stocktaking for retailers considerably faster. Codes could be used to marketers to offer recipes and to provide product information on the ingredients, producers, production circumstances, etc. Imagine this combined with a personalized shopper profile so the buyer can determine whether a product fits their health and dietary requirements and a smart fridge that tells the shopper what ingredients they already have that are close to expiry date and you can see just a few of the possibilities.

Manninen predicts that smart kitchens will be a reality in 5-10 years and will need to utilize logic to be truly functional. "A fridge is not smart if it doesn't know what it has inside it" he said.

As IoT's footprint expands every day, it will provide massive opportunities for manufacturers, marketers and consumers. The "Internet of Packaging" is here and will become part of our everyday reality before we know it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's plain to see that emerging technology has changed the retail experience beyond recognition.

We can shop on the internet anywhere, and at any time, without a physical cash transaction and have it delivered to us in what can feel like the blink of an eye. In times where retail fashion can be bought in seconds and free returns mean that your apartment can be an at-home changing room, I was interested to talk last week to Healey Cypher, co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.oaklabs.is/">Oak</a> and creator of a hardware enabled platform that uses mirrors as a conduit to transform the retail experience.

Oak has creating the Oak Mirror, a connected device that turns the bricks-and-mortar retail experience into one that is closer in reality to what we have come accustomed to online. Cypher reminded me that while it's easy to do your shopping online, it still only accounts for a small amount of all retail sales:
<blockquote>"In-store sales are still up to 95% of all retail experiences and e-commerce is less than 7% of all retail transactions. Retail is a $12 trillion industry that employs a quarter of the people in the US. and accounts for 50% of  expenditure of disposable income."</blockquote>
It is an sector that Cypher is passionate about, particularly in regard to improving the customer experience. Usually trying on clothing means stumbling around a store semi-dressed to find a different size or dealing with the ministrations of an overeager sales attendant who whips back the curtain to catch you in your...unawares.

But Oak wants to make that a thing of the past.

They currently have embedded their technology in a range of Ralph Lauren stores in the US. All in-store items are connected to it with RFID chips. This means an almost self-curated shopping  experience. Any clothes you select to try on appear on a connected touch screen which is part of the dressing room mirror. Need a new size or a different color? Just tap the screen and a store assistant - each outfitted with a corresponding iPad - brings you your choice. The screen also offers you styling recommendations based on what's available in store and you can email your selection to yourself for future consideration.

&nbsp;

<img class="wp-image-1757 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Oak-Labs-product-image-1024x576.jpg" alt="Oak Labs product image" width="677" height="381" />

For those a little more discerning, the mirror even offered a variety of lighting experiences: Fifth Avenue Daylight, East Hampton Sunset and Evening at The Polo Bar.

It's easy to dismiss such notions as gimmick but the reality is that Oak see the benefits of their platform far beyond novelty factors.
<blockquote>"The RFID gives perfect data. This means stores can always know what's in stock at a glance, including size and colors. The average industry inventory accuracy is 65% in retail. It also enables buyers to see what other people bring into the fitting room and what items they are buying together. You learn whether certain items are always tried in one size but bought in another or tried but never purchased".</blockquote>
All of which is especially important for fashion houses, especially those that stock "fast fashion," defined as fashion cycles of six weeks or less.

Cypher admits that fashion is a traditional industry that has in some respects been slow to adopt technology. Two of the leading reasons he attributes this to are generational norms - "Younger, digital natives are more likely to adopt this technology than older store owners" - and also the difficulty in "getting retailers uses to expending capital on technology. They are more likely to see the value in expenditure on their front of house signage."

Yet, as Cypher notes, "consumers want things fast, easy, beautiful, robust and personal." This will be the reality of retail fashion, and Oak is keen to be part of this innovation, blurring the boundaries between the digital and physical retail experience.

		<title>Is Seoul the world&#039;s smartest city?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In many ways, the city of Seoul is both a blueprint "how-to" guide for smart city development and a petri-dish for technological experiments. Almost every aspect of public life in Seoul is guided by technology, from its <a href="http://city.lgcns.com/Contents/EN/Main/Main.aspx">integrated public transport system</a> to the government's emergency warning system.

Companies like <a href="https://citynetmembers.wordpress.com/2013/10/08/announcing-microsoft-citynext-joins-the-2013-citynet-seoul-congress/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/KR/innovationcenter/songdo/index-en.html">Cisco</a> and <a href="http://city.lgcns.com/Contents/EN/Main/Main.aspx">LG</a> are just a few of those making technology omnipresent in the South Korean capital. It's a constantly evolving process and when you think of a new "smart city" technology, it's most likely that Seoul did it first - and probably some time ago.

<a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/05/07/smart-cities-open-wireless-standards-ct4/"><em>See also: Open wireless standards could chop city costs by nearly a third</em></a>

While it can be hard to compare one city's "smarts" to another's, here are just a few examples of the technologies that may make Seoul the world's smartest city.

<strong>Smart devices everywhere </strong>

According to a 2013 <a href="http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/23/01/T23010000190001PDFE.pdf">report</a>, Seoul has a history empowering residents to be connected to technology. In 2012, Seoul began distributing second-hand smart devices to low-income families and others in need. Citizens are encouraged to donate their old devices when buying new ones, incentivized by tax deduction in the range of $50-100 per device donated.

Seoul has been providing education courses on smart consumer technologies since 2009, offering both city-run lectures and city-funded classes through private education institutions. Aimed at immigrants, low-income individuals and elderly people using smart devices for the first time, these classes attracted over 47,000 people from 2009 to 2011. Although still addressing the basics of smart technology use, these classes will, in the future, teach more advanced skills, giving more citizens the tools to improve smart Seoul’s services.

<strong>Roads that recharge</strong>

<img class="wp-image-1952 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/19d1ef4e9ed63ab20c655638a25ee150-1-768x1024.jpg" alt="19d1ef4e9ed63ab20c655638a25ee150 (1)" width="440" height="587" />

OLEV (Online electric vehicle technology) enables vehicles to transfer electricity wirelessly from the road surface while they're moving. As a bus drives through along one of the recharging surfaces, power comes from electrical cables buried under the surface of the road, creating magnetic fields. There is a receiving device installed on the underbody of the OLEV that converts these fields into electricity. The length of power strips installed under the road is generally 5%-15% of the entire road, requiring only a few sections of the road to be rebuilt with the embedded cables.

The strip of road lined with cables is also able to distinguish OLEV buses from regular vehicles, meaning it can switch itself off when it's not in use. As the buses don't need to hold enough charge for the entirety of their journeys, their batteries are around three times smaller than those on most electric vehicles.

<strong>u-Seoul Safety Service</strong>

<a href="https://www.tekes.fi/globalassets/global/ohjelmat-ja-palvelut/ohjelmat/ubicom/aineistot/raportit/korea/ubiquitouscityinkorea.pdf">u-Seoul Safety Service</a> has been in operation since April 2008, combining location-based services and CCTV technologies to notify authorities and family members of emergencies involving children, the disabled, the elderly, and those suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, all of whom are voluntarily equipped with a smart device. When its holder leaves a designated safe zone or pushes its emergency button, an emergency alert is sent to guardians, police, fire departments and CCTV Control Centers.

<strong>Open Governance and Public Data</strong>

<a href="http://citynet-ap.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Seoul-e-Government-English.pdf">Seoul’s open governance strategy</a> encourages transparent city governance and open communication between the city’s government and its citizens. Citizens and the private sector are consequently encouraged to make use of the city’s administrative information to uncover new job and business opportunities.  In March 2013, using GPS embedded in smartphones, the Seoul Metropolitan Government began to offer “Information around myself on maps,” a feature that provides information on locations of free Wi-Fi zones, disabled-friendly facilities, unmanned certification-issuing equipment, restrooms, and construction sites.

There is also the <a href="http://120dasan.seoul.go.kr/foreign/english.html">Dasan Call Center,</a> a 24/7 government agency that fields all questions regarding city services. Residents can also book public services and utilities through the internet 24/7.

<strong>Eunpyeong u-City</strong>

<a href="http://city.lgcns.com/Contents/EN/CaseStudy/CaseView.aspx?pageNo=1&amp;iclsNo=&amp;caseNo=21&amp;searchStr=%22"> Eunpyeong u-City</a> is perhaps the most "Big Brother" example of a smart city. It's the result of a 7-year project completed in 2011 and now houses 45,000 people on land covering 862 acres. Eunpyeong’s residents do not require private Internet access or smart devices to make use of city services, and instead receive practical information via smart devices on their living room walls. In the interests of residents’ safety, intelligent CCTV cameras installed on every street corner automatically detect people trespassing on private premises.

The city’s high-tech street lamps reduce energy us, and provide residents with wireless internet access. The city’s <a href="https://www.tekes.fi/globalassets/global/ohjelmat-ja-palvelut/ohjelmat/ubicom/aineistot/raportit/korea/ubiquitouscityinkorea.pdf">u-Green service</a> represents a network of sensors assessing factors such as water and air quality, transmitting this information directly to public spaces and the devices in citizen’s living rooms.

<strong>Virtual stores</strong>

<img class="wp-image-1942 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/0000ab89-1024x697.jpeg" alt="0000ab89" width="604" height="411" />

International grocery chain, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/mobile-phones/8601147/Tesco-builds-virtual-shops-for-Korean-commuters.html">Tescos</a> has had virtual stores in Seoul in public spaces since 2011. Products are laid out just as they’d be in a traditional shop. The "shelves" feature QR codes which can be scanned by the traveller’s mobile phone, building up a shopping basket in the few minutes before the train arrives. If your train comes before your basket is complete, you can carry on shopping without the pictures and codes.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple has been instrumental in pairing medicine and mobile technology through its series of kits. In March 2015, they launched <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/03/09Apple-Introduces-ResearchKit-Giving-Medical-Researchers-the-Tools-to-Revolutionize-Medical-Studies.html">ResearchKit</a>, an open source software framework to help scientists and doctors not only create medical apps but also recruit patients for clinical trials and research products.

ResearchKit turns iPhone into a powerful tool for medical research. When granted permission by the user, apps can access data from the Health app such as weight, blood pressure, glucose levels and asthma inhaler use, which are measured by third-party devices and apps. ResearchKit can also request from a user, access to the accelerometer, microphone, gyroscope and GPS sensors in iPhone to gain insight into a patient’s gait, motor impairment, fitness, speech and memory.

In March this year, they <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2016/03/21Apple-Advances-Health-Apps-with-CareKit.html">announced CareKit</a>, a new development framework for clinical care apps. The software is designed help developers enable people to actively manage their own medical conditions through app-based care plans, and symptom and medication monitoring. This can leads to insights that help people better understand their own health.

CareKit currently includes four modules:
<ol>
	<li><em>Care Card</em> helps people track their individual care plans and action items, such as taking medication or completing physical therapy exercises. Activities can automatically be tracked and entered using sensors in Apple Watch® or iPhone</li>
	<li><em>Symptom and Measurement Tracke</em>r lets users easily record their symptoms and how they’re feeling, like monitoring temperature for possible infections or measuring pain or fatigue. Progress updates could include simple surveys, photos that capture the progression of a wound or activities calculated by using the iPhone’s accelerometer and gyroscope, like quantifying range of motion;</li>
	<li><em>Insight Dashboard</em> maps symptoms against the action items in the Care Card to easily show how treatments are working</li>
	<li><em>Connect</em> makes it easy for people to share information and communicate with doctors, care teams or family members about their health and any change in condition</li>
</ol>
Research kits has been met with positive results from the medical community. “With ResearchKit, we quickly realized the power of mobile apps for running inexpensive, high-quality clinical studies with unprecedented reach,” said Ray Dorsey, MD, David M. Levy Professor of Neurology at the University of Rochester Medical Center.
<blockquote>“We hope that CareKit will help us close the gap between our research findings and how we care for our Parkinson’s patients day-to-day. It’s opening up a whole new opportunity for the democratization of research and medicine.”</blockquote>

<h2>Apple seeks to professionalize health apps</h2>
Apple's efforts leads to a greater professionalisation of 'health and wellbeing' apps- a lucrative industry that lacks any accredited regulation. At present they do not need to be designed by or in collaboration with health professionals or endorse tools or treatments that are subject to peer reviewed papers and research based trials.  For example, a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4376135/#ref68" target="_blank">study released </a>in 2015 analyzing 243 depression apps available during 2013 revealed that many fail to incorporate evidence-based practices, health behavior theory, or clinical expertise into their design. The study excluded almost this many again for the lack of reporting of organizational affiliation and content sources.

Likewise,<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26787311"> a study</a> was released this year of apps that explicitly included or advertised pregnancy prevention or decision-making support. Intensive analysis was undertaken of 18 apps. Of these,  41% of apps did not mention any modern contraceptive methods and 23% mentioned only 1 method. Of apps that did mention a modern contraceptive method, fewer than 50% of these apps provided information on how to use it. The researchers further found that most apps  miss opportunities to provide users with valuable information, interactive decision aids, and evidence-based interventions for unintended pregnancy prevention. The researcher further contend that
<blockquote>"some apps in this space may increase the likelihood of unintended pregnancy due to the low effectiveness of the contraceptive methods promoted."</blockquote>
<a href="http://www.psychology.org.au/Content.aspx?ID=5850" target="_blank">Other research highlights</a> the problem of clinical assessment of apps due to search terms/procedures used, the retail stores/research databases searched and the criteria that is used to determine app quality.
<h2>What is and isn't a health app?</h2>
According to <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/.../UCM263366.pdf">guidelines</a> by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  in February 2015, apps that are considered a medical device category, require FDA review before they can go to market legally. A medical device can include software that is intended for use in one of three situations:
<ol>
	<li>To diagnose a disease or other condition</li>
	<li>Cure, mitigate, prevent, or treat a disease</li>
	<li>Affect a bodily function or structure</li>
</ol>
Interestingly, there are also several categories of mobile apps for which the FDA plans to exercise enforcement discretion but not actively regulate. These include apps that:
<ul>
	<li>Help users self-manage their disease or condition without providing specific treatment or treatment suggestions</li>
	<li>Provide patients with simple tools to organize and track their health information</li>
	<li>Provide easy access to information related to a patient’s health conditions or treatments</li>
	<li>Help patients document, show, or communicate potential medical conditions to healthcare providers</li>
	<li>Automate simple tasks for healthcare providers</li>
	<li>Enable patients or providers to interact with personal health records or electronic health record systems</li>
</ul>
It's highly likely that most developers of health apps who are not science or health professionals themselves, are most likely to want to avoid a FDA review-a process that is time consuming and expensive. Rather than reducing the amount of apps on offer, it is more likely to result in more generic or generalist knowledge or a self-classification under "well-being," a category that the FDA considers most relative to a healthy lifestyle than health.
<h2>What is missing from AppleKits?</h2>
It's notable that while Apple has been working hard to create software platforms suitable for iPhone apps, there has been something of a missed opportunity for engagement with other connected devices utilized now (or in the future) by health professionals that would utilize CareKit. For example, whilst patients can share medical data with doctors, there is no corresponding platform for integrating the data into patient electronic health records or a means to compare the data with other patients utilizing the same app. Whilst patient adherence is a common challenge of any health regime, without tools to ensure health professionals can also do so with the resultant data is imperative.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Crownstone takes home automation beyond Alexa</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sensor technology seems to be one of the biggest buzz technologies of late, and companies like DoBots are bringing it to home automation. <a href="https://dobots.nl/">DoBots</a> is a spinoff of <a href="http://www.almende.com/home">Almende</a>, a research institute in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. DoBots specializes in artificial intelligence, for robots and home automation alike. I recently spoke to roboticist and COO, Anne van Rossum about through their soon to be shipped product, <a href="http://crownstone.rocks/">Crownstone</a>, a home automation device that relies on indoor localization over voice activated commands.

The Crownstone is a Bluetooth low-energy smart power outlet that can be embedded everywhere in a workplace building or household via the power points. While people can use their smartphone or corresponding devices to control their home automation, the technology also enables the building to know where the people are in each room. This means Crownstone can react to your presence by switching on lights and home appliances and in turn, react to your absence by switching off devices of choice, effectively putting powering down much of your home when you are absent in those rooms. Van Rossum describes their product as:
<blockquote>"a first step step to make your home aware of you and your presence. It is able to observe or behavior through how we use devices and allows our home to adapt to our needs. They can function as a very affordable $25 dollar wake-up light, and switch off energy-hungry devices like modems and TVs. However, their AI allows them to also recognize situations. Your grandma who doesn't come out of bed. Your electrical kettle without water. Your television that gets plugged out at night if you're not around. Suspicious or dangerous situations that it recognizes because it is able to identify devices and learns your behavior and the behavior of the other people around you."</blockquote>
<img class="size-large wp-image-1816 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/26897087616_06297a82a0_z.jpg" alt="26897087616_06297a82a0_z" width="640" height="426" />

The applicability for such technology is apparent in modern workplaces where be used in finding work spots and planning meeting rooms. It is particularly useful in a large office where it can be used to locate staff trained in first aid in an emergency or determine occupancy measures to set up contracts for performance-based cleaning. The Crownstone identifies devices based on their power consumption pattern. It also detects your presence, for example your lights will turn on and off.

The product's indoor localization technology includes iBeacon functionality. According to van Rossum:
<blockquote>"This enables you to build services on top of it. The device uses robotic technology, specifically a technique called SLAM, (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping">simulataneous localization and mapping</a>). It allows a robot to position itself and build a map of so-called landmarks in its environment. In our case a human is the robot and it uses the Crownstones to pinpoint its location indoors. Moreover, because we use this state of the art method you do not need to tell the system where you have plugged in those Crownstones. By just walking around the location of your smart power outlets is inferred automatically. The system is learning all this on itself".</blockquote>
DoBots have made Crownstones open source, meaning people can experiment with app development and iBeacon and write their own corresponding apps.]]></content:encoded>

In pilot tests of the Intelligent Restroom, Kimberly-Clark Professional has been able to reduce the amount of supplies used in the restroom by up to 20 percent.

<span class="xn-person">According to Bryan Semkuley</span>, Vice President of Global Innovation at Kimberly-Clark Professional. "We wanted to help our clients reduce tenant churn, lower costs, and improve the customers' experience along the way. That's when we turned to innovations in cloud and IoT from IBM that can be operated from facilities managers' smartphones."
<blockquote>"Kimberly-Clark Professional products are used by one fourth of the world's population on a regular basis," said <span class="xn-person">Rachel Reinitz</span>, IBM Distinguished Engineer and CTO, IBM Bluemix Garage. "IBM Cloud, from development platform through IoT, enabled them to develop and deploy the innovative Intelligent Restroom from the ground up."</blockquote>
<h2>Will the connected bathroom be coming to your home?</h2>

If you are curious whether such technology extends to the home, the answer is yes...and no. IoT company <a href="http://www.rollscout.com/index.php/available-styles">RollScout</a> launched a (failed) <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/04/24/crowdfunding-iot-projects-watch-week-dl1/">crowdfunding</a> effort in 2014 for a connected toilet roll holder, relying on sensor technology, to notify folks when the toilet roll needed to be replenished. When the level of paper on the roll fell below a certain level, a warning system was turned on, a pulsing ring of amber light bright enough to be noticeable even in daylight conditions along with a corresponding app. The company was offered the devices from $79 to a gold-plated version for $149. Unfortunately, they never went to market. An idea before its time?

<img class="wp-image-1678 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/img_a011001003_01.jpg" alt="img_a011001003_01" width="666" height="333" />

Predictably, connected toilets also exist. In Japan, there's the <a href="http://www.lixil.co.jp/lineup/toiletroom/satis/smartphone/">Satis</a>, a connected toilet where an app can enable the lifting of the toilet seas or a flush. The app also lets the user maintain a diary of toilet use and even play music through built-in speakers.

You can also buy  a toilet with all the bells and whistles courtesy of <a href="http://www.panasonic.hk/english/products/living/bathroom-appliances/toilet-seat/dl-sz45hwm.aspx">Panasonic</a> for around $700, complete with a remote control seat lifter and self cleaner. Not surprisingly, there were reports in January this year of connected toilet hacking. According to the UK's<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/hackers-take-control-toilet-using-7342662"> Mirror </a>newspaper,
<blockquote>"Researchers found that one of these high-tech toilets was protected with only a basic password. This meant they could take control of the toilet, allowing them to flush it at an awkward moment or even surprise people by unexpectedly aiming a jet of water at their nether regions".</blockquote>
Not all that smart really.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The technological advances inherent in the Internet of Things (IoT) are providing researchers, town planners, ecologists and scientists with new ways to not only prevent, but also solve, environmental problems -- from <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/04/20/buddy-iot-impact-solve-flint-water-crisis-il4/">toxic water supplies</a> to <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/04/29/internet-of-things-climate-change-cl4/">reducing climate change in rural areas</a>. Here are some of ways IoT is bringing sustainability:
<h2>#1. Reducing e-waste</h2>
<img class=" wp-image-2075 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/3015164_6e979e27.jpg" alt="3015164_6e979e27" width="566" height="418" />

The problem of e-waste is familiar to anyone with old devices. Once a device becomes obsolete or beyond repair, it invariably ends up in landfill, often in another country. While there have been schemes to <a href="http://www.zoo.org.au/get-involved/act-for-wildlife/theyre-calling-on-you">refurnish phones</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/browse/home/specialdeals/mac">computers</a>, the sheer scale of e-waste is a complex problem. Many sustainability experts have suggested that the tech industry should take some responsibility as the enablers of the problem in the first place, and through this process, the notion of <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy">the circular economy</a> has grown. A circular economy is characterized as one that "is restorative and regenerative by design and which aims to keep products, components and materials at their highest utility and value at all times."

<a href="http://www.weforum.org/reports/project-mainstream-global-collaboration-accelerate-transition-towards-circular-economy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Project Mainstream</a> is global project targeting areas of sustainability thwarted by complexities such as e-waste, using a circular economy model. As connected devices are embedded with chips and sensors, they can be tracked throughout their life cycles. In the future, this means that consumers will be notified when older products can be repaired or refurbished. If a device is returned to the manufacturer  - as an alternative to disposal - the sensors will signal which components can be repurposed or reused. One example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2016/04/22/circular-economy-earth-day/">IBM</a> is working to keep industrial products in continuous loops to maximize residual value and ensure that end-of-lease and client-owned IT equipment is refurbished, resold, disassembled or sold as parts, to be used for repair and maintenance work.
<h2>#2. Tracking endangered species</h2>
IoT technology has enabled scientists, conservationists and citizen scientists to track and quantify endangered species through an increased ability to collect, transmit, store and share data. In the Phillipines, dugongs are photographed by local fishermen then uploaded to a central database. The fishermen, many of whom are unable to read or write, are being trained to use the smartphones and are being provided with local charging facilities. The tracking enables conservationists to lobby for appropriate sea protections where dugongs are situated.

In Australia honey bees are fitted with tiny micro censors by the <a href="http://www.csiro.au/en/Research/BF/Areas/Protecting-Australias-agricultural-industries/Robot-technology/Swarm-sensing">CSIRO</a> to monitor bee movements. The research is being led by CSIRO and aims to improve honey bee pollination and productivity on farms, as well as help understand the drivers of bee Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), a condition decimating honey bee populations worldwide. The sensors are tiny radio frequency identification sensors that work in a similar way to a vehicle's e-tag, recording when the insect passes a particular checkpoint. The information is then sent remotely to a central location to help scientists increase their knowledge of bee migration. The censors have also been trialled in Brazil and are predicted to work well in remote locations, particularly when the sensors will be able to generate power from insect movement and store energy in batteries.
<h2>#3. Fighting deforestation</h2>
<img class=" wp-image-2074 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/download-1.jpeg" alt="download" width="643" height="857" />

The use of drones to <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/gadgets/conservationists-launch-cheap-drone-monitor-deforestation-and-endangered-species.html">monitor deforestation</a> is nothing new, but U.K.-based company <a href="http://www.biocarbonengineering.com/">BioCarbon Engineering</a> is working to use drones in the fight against deforestation. In an effort to plant a billion trees a year, drones take detailed 3D images of the landscape to determine the nutrients, biodiversity and topology. This is followed by a precision planting pattern where the drone fires a biodegradable seed pod at each position, each containing nutrients for healthy tree growth. While the program is still in planning stages, it has potential to provide fast and accurate reforestation.

In many tropical countries, there's a thriving black market for illegally cut timber. <a href="http://www.earthobservation.com/what-we-do-1">Earth Observation</a>, a provider of forest and marine monitoring solutions, has developed an infrared and GPS-based system that creates a unique biometric record of individual trees that have been legally authorized for harvest and uses a smartphone app to transmit data to a tracking system. The system is designed to circumvent opportunities for bribes and falsification of data that allow the trade in illegally cut timber to flourish. Using proprietary algorithms, TreeTAG generates a one-time code that captures precise data on the potential maximum yield of each tree, as well as the species, time, date, and exact location where each tree is felled. If a tree is cut outside of a government-authorized logging concession, the system will not generate a “tag.”
<h2>#4. Monitoring the oceans</h2>
Where you start thinking about the internet in the ocean you know the possibilities of technology are getting very big. <a href="http://www.catalinasearanch.com/Catalinasearanch.com/Monitoring.html">Catalina Sea Ranch</a> is an America's first off shore shellfish ranch. Besides fishing, they are also working on creating a wireless data capturing system for the ocean.

As CEO Phil Cruver <a href="https://agfundernews.com/how-to-build-a-data-capturing-internet-of-things-for-the-ocean5478.html">explains</a>:
<blockquote>"<a href="http://www.ioos.noaa.gov/">The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Integrated Ocean Observation System</a> (IOOS) provided a NOMAD buoy that will be anchored at our ranch and equipped numerous marine embedded sensors at strategic positions in the horizontal and vertical water plane. The wireless sensor network will help generate continuous real-time data, which will be transmitted to the cloud for remote and independent analysis by research institutions and to offer insights for offshore aquaculture operations."</blockquote>
In Italy, researchers at <a href="http://fp7-sunrise.eu/index.php">SUNRISE</a> are also working to enable seas, lakes and rivers to be digital highways for data transfer from sensors, robots, and underwater vehicles capable of performing tasks too dangerous for humans. These include environmental monitoring  - both shallow and deep water - as well as border control and protection of offshore critical infrastructures, de-mining, surveillance and protection of submerged archaeological sites.  Efforts include an underwater communication system based on acoustic waves, which can travel tens of kilometres under water. It's a long-term, complex and cross-collaborative protect that, if successful, will revolutionize our understanding of the ocean as we know it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Getting into the smart home hardware business, today Google debuted <a href="https://home.google.com/">Google Home</a>, a voice-activated home automation system, at the firm's annual developer's conference, <a href="https://events.google.com/io2016/">Google I/O 2016</a>.

We've had a few teasers over the last few months and <a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/5/11/11658432/google-chirp-amazon-echo-rival">Recode</a> previously reported that Google has been working on a portable speaker containing a built-in voice-activated assistant for the whole family in a prototype called "Chirp."

Mario Queiroz, VP of product management, introduced Google Home, stating that it "lets you enjoy music and entertainment, manage every day tasks and <em>Ask Google</em> what you what to do, via a voice assistant." It's preceded by the firm's Chromecast product, one that enables consumers to play music videos and movies from a small device to the big screen.

<img class="size-medium wp-image-2200 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-05-18-at-19.31.37-300x258.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-18 at 19.31.37" width="300" height="258" />
<h2>Home automation space getting crowded</h2>
Google home is also Wi-Fi speaker that streams music directly from the cloud for clear playback via verbal request or through Google. Consumers will be able to request music in specific rooms or request multi-room playback.

Queiroz unveiled a video displaying the possibilities of using Google Home for requests like checking for flight delays to rebooking restaurants to answering homework questions, demonstrating the growing reality that there's no need for kids to talk to their parents ever again.

It'll not only answer your queries and organize your life, Google Home promises to connect your other smart home devices: lights, thermostat, switches and - of course - Google's own Nest devices, with Querioz predicting that in the future it will control things beyond the home, via the voice assistant function.

IoT developer Qiming Fang said Google Home looks familiar. "To be honest, from the demo, <span class="s1">I don’t really see it as that different from (Amazon's) Echo," he said. "I think the developer community  - and Google or Amazon’s ability to react quickly and revamp their APIs - will be the key to which product ends up taking off."</span>

He also noted that there was only a cursory mention of how Google Home will connect with products such as Nest:
<blockquote>"<span class="s1">If Nest can detects something out of the ordinary, Google Home could potentially also be used as a warning system. Multiple devices cold also </span><span class="s1">create a network of warning systems, </span><span class="s1">like if one person’s kitchens lights on fire by accident, neighboring homes could be warned."</span></blockquote>
This device will be a considerable competitor to Amazon's Alexa, launched in 2015. Apple, Microsoft and Google all have voice-activated assistants, but up until now, they've been limited to mobile devices.

Google may be announcing the feature today  to enable developers to start building apps and integrations for the platform before its physical launch. At any rate, it will be a key component of Google's assistant ecosystem and evidence suggests there's more to come.

		<title>Calm, cruel and connected: May&#039;s best and worst of IoT</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>

It seems that every day a new IoT device or means to connect existing devices is revealed. With so much energy in being devoted to tell us how, when, where, what we can connect to each other, the “why” may be getting a little blurry. So we want to take a step back every now and<a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/05/01/best-and-worst-iot-week-vr1/"> take a critical look</a> at the connected devices that actually go out and buy, right now.

<em>(Ed note: We also do a <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/04/24/crowdfunding-iot-projects-watch-week-dl1/">round-up of crowdfunding</a> ideas you can’t quite get yet…or possibly should never be able to get.) </em>Here’s what caught our eye, for all the right – or wrong – reasons:
<h2>Smiirl's social media counter</h2>
<img class=" wp-image-2118 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-05-17-at-10.04.57.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-17 at 10.04.57" width="623" height="477" />
Some people need regular validation. They stare in the mirror and think "But do people really like me?" If such people started a business, this would be the product for them, <a href="http://www.smiirl.com/en/">a visual counter by Smiirl </a>displaying their company's number of Twitter, Facebook or Instagram likes. As the company explains:
<blockquote>
<div>"Place it in your window to attract new customers, hang it on a wall to convince them to join your community, or even in your offices to motivate your teams!"</div>
<div></div></blockquote>
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">It'll put you back $300 per counter and you'll need one for each social media platform. Sit and watch your popularity drop. <strong>Verdict: Miss.</strong></span>
<h2>The Smart Zabuton</h2>
<img class=" wp-image-2120 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/4.jpg" alt="4" width="589" height="423" />

For cafe staff too busy staring at the social media counter to notice that their customers have moved from their seats, there is the <a href="http://www.keyvalue.jp/?stage=press_smartchair">Smart Zabuton</a>, a cushion with that emits a signal when sat on (no, not like a whoopie cushion). This allows cafe staff to use the corresponding app to check how many seats are free in a cafe or restaurant. I guess it could come in handy if you are managing an event like a public awards ceremony that requires <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_filler">seat fillers</a>. It could also be used at work by a controlling boss to see how long you spend sitting at your desk. <strong>Verdict: Miss.</strong>
<h2>my.Flow</h2>
<img class="wp-image-2184 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/0320000008445374-photo-my-flow.jpg" alt="0320000008445374-photo-my-flow" width="639" height="388" />

Did you know someone has made a smart tampon? You seem shocked. Anyway, the<a href="http://www.trackmyflow.com/"> my.flow</a> notifies the wearer when it needs to be changed. It works via a long tampon string that reaches out of your underwear and attaches to a snap-on bluetooth sensor. This bluetooth sensor can then be clipped on to your waistband.This sensor then sends data to an app on your phone, analyzing how saturated the tampon has become and alerting the wearer when they need to swap out their tampon for a new one. While it's commendable that the makers are aiming to solve the serious problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_shock_syndrome">toxic shock syndrome</a> and blood leakages onto clothing, I'm not convinced that this is the way.

The company is currently seeking funding with the intention to sell the sensor for a one-time price of $49. I'm genuinely amazed how many prizes this product has won, especially when more technology is addressing the problem in innovative ways like <a href="http://www.dearkates.com/pages/technology-new">high tech absorbent underwear</a>. It's also reminiscent of the <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/01/08/ces-2016-misses/">Pro-pregnancy tracker</a> in being a rather redundant means to solve an issue. <strong>Verdict: Miss.</strong>
<h2>Triby</h2>
<img class="wp-image-2185 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Triby-At-home-soon-big-1024x768.jpg" alt="Triby-At-home-soon-big" width="680" height="510" />
Mobile phones are not conducive to the kitchen environment. I'm a keen cook and often find myself unable to answer the phone due to fingers encased with dough. I've also had the unpleasant experience of dropping a mobile in a sink full of water from an apron product while teaching a class. The Triby by <a href="http://www.invoxia.com/">Invoxia</a> comes to my rescue.
<div>

Triby is a digital assistant, Internet radio, connected speaker, hands-free speakerphone, and connected message board all rolled into one. Amongst other things, people can send messages, emoji and hand drawn doodles to Triby ’s E-Ink display via its dedicated app. In April it was the first non-Amazon product to be <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/05/11/amazon-alexa-packages-il4/">Alexa-enabled </a>which means that users customers have hands-free voice control for information from Wikipedia and the web, weather, timers and alarms, news, shopping/to-do lists, sports updates and scores, smart home features, calendar entries, IFTTT, and much more—with new skills being added every week. It retails at $199 and I suspect it won't be long before cheaper versions hit the market but with less sensitivity. <strong>Verdict: Hit.</strong>
<h2>Bitlock</h2>
<img class=" wp-image-2168 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/yellow.png" alt="yellow" width="593" height="631" />
As a person who loses keys more often than I'd like to admit, this product is very appealing. I also live in Berlin, where bike thefts are a huge problem - thieves literally go around with cutters and steal enough bikes to fill a truck.  <a href="http://bitlock.co/">BitLock</a> is made of reinforced and heat-treated steel combined with a high-security disc locking mechanism. The lock is not only keyless but it's corresponding app enables users to transfer pin number access to friends or visitors. The battery lasts five years and a GPS connection to your mobile ensures that you don't lose your bike after one too many beers. And if your phone is dead, you can open BitLock by punching in a four-digit secret code with a sequence of button presses. It costs $129 which is considerably more than a key lock but would be a good investment. <strong>Verdict: Hit.</strong>
<h2>BMW Motorcycles' Emergency Call</h2>
<img class=" wp-image-2123 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/P90217584-lowRes.jpg" alt="P90217584-lowRes" width="533" height="377" />
In a serious motor vehicle accident, it's vital to get help as soon as possible. BMW is introducing the intelligent eCall system, which is either automatically or manually triggered and sends out the position data - the coordinates of the motorcycle accident site - to a qualified BMW Call Center to initiate the rescue chain. In the “intelligent emergency call” option, the connection is established via the permanently installed mobile communication unit. Sensors on the motorcycle detect which event occurred whether a collision with another vehicle or crashing into an obstruction. A banking angle sensor detects which position the motorcycle is in.
<p class="p1">The intelligent emergency call takes three scenarios into account: Automatic triggering in the case of a bad fall / collision; automatic triggering in the case of a minor fall or collision (which the rider has the option to cancel the call by pressing a button); and manual triggering by pressing the SOS button for other road users in need. A message is sent to the BMW Call Center and a voice connection is established. A voice connection is mandatory if the eCall was triggered manually before further measures are initiated. Here, too, the accident victim/rider is also given the opportunity to cancel the emergency call at the press of a button or by turning off the ignition.</p>
<p class="p1">I'm curious about the "intelligent emergency call system" how the rider can communicate with the BMW Call Center in his native language. Presumably in the future the call could go directly to emergency services? It would be great to see this kind of technology embedded in all kinds vehicles, including farm machinery like tractors.</p>

		<title>Do we really want to DIY our home automation?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[New industry research from <a href="https://www.icontrol.com/">Icontrol Networks</a>, the company behind the most widely-distributed connected home platform in the industry, has found exceptionally high satisfaction amongst customers who opted for a professionally installed smart home solution.

Icontrol Networks' DIFM ("Do it for me") Smart Home Survey revealed more than 96 percent of respondents report they are very satisfied or satisfied with their systems. Beyond satisfaction, those with professionally-installed solutions feel the cost is justified - approximately 96 percent said they would purchase their systems again and 98 percent would still opt for professional installation today.

The research surveyed 552 respondents across seven branded smart home solutions – including solutions powered by Icontrol Networks as well as other technology providers. Admittedly it's a relatively small subject sample, but the results are unusually positive suggesting a high degree of satisfaction in smart home products.

The report also found that security and peace-of-mind reign supreme during the decision making process and are top motivating factors for customer retention, with general security concerns and specific security events being the top reasons most people purchase a system in the first place.
<h2>DIY could mean missing out on some features</h2>
While 98 percent of respondents said their systems were easy to learn and use, most are still using their systems for single-device control instead of whole home automation where devices work together seamlessly. And although all providers mentioned in the survey offer systems with scheduling or automation features, only 29 and 35 percent of respective users thought their solutions offered these features, pointing to a lack of awareness around the offering.

While less than a quarter of respondents installed third-party devices, those that did were most likely to install smart thermostats, smart garage doors and Amazon Echo.

Most customers who purchased a smart home system were already proactively looking for a system, but when it came to picking a provider, reputation proved to matter.  When asked why they chose their service provider, more than half (60%) cited the reputation of the company. When evaluating systems, most went to websites (72%) or recommendations by family/friends  (51%), and 43% found more information via advertising.
<h2>What DIYers found most difficult</h2>
When asked about difficulty of usage, most customers reported setting alerts, schedules and automation rules as the most difficult features of the system to use.  This is interesting considering how many systems there are to connect multiple devices, does it mean that a fully connected home is more accessible to the DIY home installer than those who opt for professionally installed system?  It suggested in the first instance, that there is a need for professionally installed providers to take time (possibly on an ongoing basis) to educate customers on the possibilities.

Customers are relying on materials supplied by service providers (both printed and online) to learn the system, which indicates the importance for companies to develop appropriate education documentation. The data also shows that once customers have had their system for some time, they turn to customer support to troubleshoot proving that a knowledgeable tech support team is invaluable.

Most customers printed instructions (59%) to learn their systems, as well as the online user guide (54%).When it comes to troubleshooting issues, customers overwhelmingly relied on customer service/technical support (76% of total). This demonstrates that there is a need for clear, ongoing training and support for consumers in the smart home market.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In January this year, India's central government announced the first list of 20 cities that have been identified for development as smart cities, part of government plans to develop 100 Smart Cities by the end of 2022.

The plans came about in part, via the <a href="http://www.smartcitieschallenge.in/challenge-overview">Smart Cities Challenge</a> funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies. The Government of India launched this challenge as a selection process to distribute central government funding to 100 cities over three years.

However it would be a misnomer to assume that smart city development in India is only in it's elementary stages. Since 2014 Cisco have been involved in consulting with local government and development authorities to bring connected capabilities to cities like Hamburg, Barcelona and Adelaide.

Last week Cisco announced the city of Jaipur, Rajasthan - a city of 3.5 million residents and over 40 million tourists visiting annually - will be the first Smart+Connected Community "Lighthouse City" in South Asia.

Under the consulting guidance of Cisco, the <a href="http://jda.urban.rajasthan.gov.in/content/raj/udh/jda---jaipur/en/home.html">Jaipur Development Authority </a>(JDA) is focused on developing smart city infrastructure in Jaipur to transform itself into a digital city of the future.

We spoke to Mr. Shikhar Agrawal, Commissioner, Jaipur Development Authority,<strong> </strong>Government of Rajasthan and Shri Arijit Banerjee,<strong> </strong>Principal Officer on Special Duty to Chief Minister, Government of Rajasthan.

The project has been broken down into two phases so far, as Mr Agrawal explained:
<blockquote>" The first phase was about creating digital infrastructure to offer citizens amenities including interactive, intelligent kiosks and wireless broadband. The kiosks enable people to book transport, find shopping locations, find their way around, and we also have set up spaces for free mobile phone recharging. These are all especially useful in the tourist areas. We're the first city in the country to have 30 public wifi portals. We make these viable by being free up to a certain point and once a person reaches the paid point, the money earned goes back into funding the free service

We've also made it possible that public services like hospitals and education providers now have extensive Wi-Fi."

<img class="size-full wp-image-2474 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/intelligent-kiosk.jpg" alt="intelligent kiosk" width="300" height="538" /></blockquote>
The benefits of a connected city also extend to broader issues of public safety, as Mr. Agrawal discussed:
<blockquote>"Safety and security are a big part of our work including  video surveillance for public safety and security at key locations such as train stations. This includes safety mechanisms  such as an alarm if there was an unattended bag on a platform or a crime was in occurrence.

We've also set up a City Infrastructure Management Centre (CIMC) and a Response Control Room to manage the city with greater efficiency... nearly all the solutions are integrated into a digital platform. The digital platform  can aggregate data from various sensors and solutions and conduct data analytics."</blockquote>
We were curious to know if they had attained direction or best practice strategies from other connected cities. Mr. Banerjee countered that idea:
<blockquote>"We didn’t have any blueprint, we are learning as we go. I don’t think any city has a perfect end-to-end solution. Jaipur probably stands out as the city with the most number of initiatives cutting across areas of urban management. Jaipur is the blueprint that will guide other parts of India."</blockquote>
<img class="size-full wp-image-2475 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/cisco-jaipur-smart-city-bgr.jpg" alt="cisco-jaipur-smart-city-bgr" width="805" height="500" />

The second phase of the project will move into broader areas of the city, according to Mr. Banerjee:
<blockquote>"We have identified 5,000 light poles that we want to make 'smart' so they are programmable and remotely controllable. They will have an integrated video camera and be connected to the control and command center. We're also working on the area of waste management so that we can automatically know when public bins need to be emptied via a sensor between the bins and the garbage trucks. We also want to be able to water leakages and better manage water maintenance."</blockquote>
Cisco also announced  - in collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies Inc., General Electric and 3M India Ltd. - the launch of an "Innovation Centre" in Jaipur to help accelerate co-innovation of  IoT-based solutions.

This center will team up with startups, developers, government agencies, and academic communities who share the same goal of bringing innovative ideas to life.

"A smart city of Jaipur enables good governance, a better quality of life and increased employment opportunities for citizens," said Mr. Agrawal.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a time of technological, medical and social advances, it's hard to believe that <a href="https://links10.mixmaxusercontent.com/XafWjr8ju5wrdG5KS/l/0yMMDit5QVz5CZFlf?messageId=4wstgyhabwbdfS9F1&amp;rn=&amp;re=gIt92YuwWah12ZAVGdhNmLz1mI" target="_blank">795 million people</a> still go hungry around the world. When we learned from one new concept that data acquired through an IoT device could end this, our interest is piqued.

<a href="http://arable.com/">Arable</a> has created PulsePod, an IoT device capable of measuring more about the environment than any other connected device in the world and can provide insight into crop health for the first time in history.

Arable was founded by Adam Wolf, a scientist with a Masters in Agronomy. Prior to Arable, he worked in one of the most remote and poverty stricken parts of the world, working with the Kazakhstan government to mitigate extreme weather and climate change. He believes the way we’re going to end hunger is by using data -- so he went to Princeton, built the PulsePod and garnered $4 million in funding from the National Science Foundation, and launched Arable shortly after that.

I spoke to Wolf about Arable this week:
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<div> "I was doing my PhD at Stanford with satellite data simulation and the crop modeling and I really become disenchanted with the model because it was built on a house of cards of faulty assumptions and I really wanted to know what was happening in the world.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There are real fundamental limitations to agriculture. It sounds crazy, but we have no idea about the sensitivity of corn to temperature. This has mammoth food security implications for the future. We don’t know if future corn yields could be about the same as now or as low as 80% yield loss. We really have limited weather stations across much of the world so there's really no visibility for a lot of people to what's happening in the field, even in very sophisticated operations. So a lot of what they are doing is guessing, driving around and checking on things, so it means there is a lot of risk exposure for a lot of people, based on assumptions about how much is in the field and what it's doing.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Even now, 30 years since I started college, there really hasn’t been a lot of change, so the same satellite imagery we studied in the 90’s, the same light sensors and data loggers are utilized. Everyone was complaining but no one was doing anything to change the situation."</div></blockquote>
<h2>How Arable and the PulsePod helps</h2>
The PulsePod features a six-band spectrometer, four-way net radiometer, and acoustic rain gauge that measures more than 40 observation streams including rain, hail, canopy leaf area, crop water demand, environmental stresses, microclimate, and even air pollution. It's always on and always connected<b> </b>(built-in bluetooth, wifi, and cellular). It's built for security (military grade encryption), flexibility (an API to plug the data into existing platforms), and control (customers choose how/when/what data to share).

Arable comes with a staff of hardware alumni: their industrial designer developed the Go Pro camera, their mechanical engineer did the design for Fitbit, and their electrical engineer developed the world’s first headset so they’re working with people that are focused around making things small and scientifically rigorous.

Wolf explained that PulsePod enables unprecedented visibility for what's happening in the field and "for the first time we see farmers able to manage the response of crops to the weather,  processors can predict future yield so they can make marketing decisions, we start to see insurance stepping in to cover risk for small holder agriculture, we really see opening up for these parts of the market that are previously inaccessible in terms of risk. This includes drought forecasting and food security; forest and crop responses to weather and climate change; and rural water usage.

Most data is generated in the US &amp; Europe, while many applications are in rural locales in the developing world. Cellular-based environmental sensing promises to provide granular data in real time from remote locales to improve model-based forecasting using data assimilation.

Wolf noted that weather and crop conditions are not measured in many developing countries. "We have been working with the Met service for Paraguay, up until now they have no weather stations,  only  a radar system for the capital Asunción, so when theres a flood it causes major traffic jams and problems for residents, monitoring allows them  to have real time granular information that can be pushed out to people so they can react.

Even in New York City, weather tracking is needed in storm management:
<blockquote>"The Mayor's Office contacted us because they have the potential to get floods, but the land underneath the pavement is so complicated that they don’t know how to connect the rainfall in Place A with where it's going to flood in Place B. Data enables them to work out where to begin, which storm drains to focus on, and how to have the biggest impact. Even in the U.S., we see a picture ranging from wheat production at $500 an acre, to berry production at $100,000 an acre. So we looked at those crops and said where do we even begin, what is the biggest possible opportunity for us to create a platform for other people to be answering questions in their place?"</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><img class="wp-image-2855 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/attachment-3-1024x683.jpeg" alt="attachment-3" width="706" height="471" /></div>
<div></div>
Wolf discussed their experiences working with one of the world's largest berry producers:
<blockquote>"There's a gigantic need and desire in forecasting for specialist crops, this is one area where there's a gigantic need and a gigantic desire but really no tools up until now. It's been a problem as long as anyone can remember. They need to know how many berries are out there in the field to make marketing decisions. So four weeks prior to harvest they were  going out, counting green berries…and they sort of do a little bit of math and estimate how many berries they’re going to sell as a company. So in a given week you’re selling a million pounds of strawberries. That decision is made on counting perhaps 50 berries, and we realized each of those berries is worth a million dollars.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If you counted more you should be marketing more, then they realize the week they harvest, 'Oh no, we actually have 1.2 million <em>tonnes</em> in strawberries' and you're faced with either selling for pennies or leaving them in the field to rot. This plays out consistently amongst speciality crops: they have no hedging, there's no exchange board, so they are highly exposed with very few tools up until now.</blockquote>
Agriculture is a sector that is greatly benefitting from innovative technology, and Arable offer solutions to problems that have previously seemed par for course. They may not end world hunger just yet, but they'll certainly make strides in tackling the challenge. So far partners include the U.S. Department of Energy, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, U.S. Agency for International Development and Treasure Wine Estates.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems that every day a new IoT device or means to connect existing devices is revealed. With so much energy in being devoted to tell us how, when, where, what we can connect to each other, the “why” may be getting a little blurry. So we want to take a step back every now and<a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/05/01/best-and-worst-iot-week-vr1/"> take a critical look</a> at the connected devices that actually go out and buy, right now.

<em>(Ed note: We also do a <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/04/24/crowdfunding-iot-projects-watch-week-dl1/">round-up of crowdfunding</a> ideas you can’t quite get yet…or possibly should never be able to get.) </em>Here’s what caught our eye, for all the right – or wrong – reasons:
<h2>Tzukuri</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3453" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/tortoise-front-3c4f21d2788e1f93f77bb2d34479a6f6-1024x728-1.jpg" alt="tortoise-front-3c4f21d2788e1f93f77bb2d34479a6f6-1024x728 (1)" width="915" height="472" />

If you're the kind of person who likes to wear expensive designer sunglasses, then these smart sunglasses by Sydney company <a href="http://www.tzukuri.com/">Tzukuri</a> are for you.  The Bluetooth-powered sunglasses are embedded with a tiny beacon on one arm and connected to an app which will send you a series of notifications if your sunglasses are away from you - unless you clear the notifications - and will show you how far away they are to help you find them. If they're not in range, it'll show you their last location on a map.

They need periodic charging and at $425 the makers predict they'll last a few years. I can see this technology being applied to prescription glasses and various headsets in the future.

<strong>Verdict: Hit</strong>
<h2>SmartPlate</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-3464 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/smart-palte.png" alt="smart-palte" width="530" height="530" />

&nbsp;

The <a href="https://getsmartplate.com/">SmartPlate</a> is one of a number of calorie controlling devices that aim to monitor and  track your eating habits. It is the world’ marketed as the "world's first"Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-enabled device that instantly tracks and analyzes everything you eat, so you never have to enter anything manually again. The SmartPlate is equipped with 3 mini-cameras (e.g. like the ones currently used in smartphones) and uses advanced object recognition to identify everything sitting on its surface. It also comes with super accurate weight sensors which enable it to weigh up to three pounds of food at once. It then combines both the image and the weight, and sends this information to the USDA's database of over 8,000 household foods for analysis in only a few seconds.

The purpose of the plate is commendable and it's integration with Fitbit is strategic. I like that it is gradually learning to calories count 'mixed' foods through algorithms. But it's questionable whether (like many fitness wearables) consumers will stick to using the plate after the initial period post purchase. It's reminiscent of the earlier the <a href="https://www.hapi.com/product/hapifork">Hapifork</a> in using connected technology to manage eating. It's success is relying on the consumer to want to continue to count calories, a method that has been<a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/06/07/481094825/a-neuroscientist-tackles-why-diets-make-us-fat"> bought into question </a>by a range of obesity experts. It retails at $120 and it is perhaps a precursor of future products that integrate a more inclusive notion of health including psychological support.

<h2>Clever Buoy</h2>

Australia has four times more fatal shark attacks than any other country. Yet shark defence methods haven’t changed in over 60 years. <a href="https://cleverbuoy.com.au/">Clever Buoy</a> is a smart ocean buoy that detects sharks and sends instant alerts to lifeguards via the Optus Network. The system is designed to be deployed at beaches that have a potential threat of shark attack. It's funded by teleco Optus, in partnership with Google

The technology utilises a combination of newly developed sonar interrogation software and satellite communications that will provide critical warning systems to beach users and vital information to shark researchers around the globe.

The Clever Buoy uses sophisticated software that differentiates between the length of an object, and its propulsion through the water. In testing it has been identified that sharks create a distinctive sonar signature and swimming pattern that is different to mammals. The development is similar to the development of ‘face recognition’ software in humans.

The detection system has been in development over the past two years with testing in controlled and wild environments. The technology has the potential to revolutionise beach safety and provide real time information to beach and ocean users. Future versions of the Clever Buoy are expected to be self-sustaining for power, by way of solar or potentially wave power.

<h2>The SubPac</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3465" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/subpac-1024x683.jpg" alt="subpac" width="1024" height="683" />

Thanks to <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/06/22/subpac-nba-promo-vt4/">recent exposure in the NBA playoffs</a>, t<a href="http://thesubpac.com/subpac-m2/">he Subpack</a> may be about to take off. It's a wearable audio device worn like a backpack. It weighs just over two kilos (4.5 pounds) with a SubPac bass thumper that sits on your back. It's marketed as delivering a great music experience through the unit's vibrotactile membranes while remaining low volume to those nearby. The idea is a tactile experience of feeling the music. The materials have also been treated with nano silver to keep bacteria and odour in check during active use.

It's priced at $329, and at a time when audio devices are getting smaller and equally refined like the <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/03/04/new-sound-experience/">Noveto Systems</a> device, it just seems like a heavy, sweaty weight, not unlike people who walk around in public with their own boom box, seeking attention of passers by. You'd really have to work out like a professional athlete to make it worth it.

<strong>Verdict: Miss</strong>

<h2>Series Commitment Rings</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-3454 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Commitment-Rings-App.jpg" alt="Commitment-Rings-App" width="720" height="720" />

<article id="unforgettable">
<div class="panel">

Ice cream company Cornetto has created an interesting gimmick product, the <a href="http://seriescommitment.com/#">Series Commitment Rings</a>, aimed at preventing one half of a relationship from forging ahead with a shared television program without the company of the other.

The Commitment Rings have NFC technology and are linked to a video streaming service account for six months. With its mobile app, couples can pick the series they want to watch together. When the rings are close to each other, the app detects them and automatically unblocks those series. The company is still in negotiation with the streaming companies and it's unclear how many rings will be distributed  -- presumably the purchase of an ice cream is involved -- but it's a fun idea.

<strong>Verdict: Hit</strong>

</div>
<h2>Smarttress</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-3455 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/smartress1-600x343.jpg" alt="smartress1-600x343" width="600" height="343" />

Another connected device with the theme of infidelity, Smarttress -- made by Spain's Durmet -- is a <a href="http://www.smarttress.com/en/">smart mattress</a> designed to keep an eye on your spouse. Based on the assumption of a cheating partner, the mattress contains a "lover detection system" of vibration censors and a “contact zones detector" that is able to send an alert to your mobile phone when your bed is being used in a "questionable way" which includes how fast the bed is moving. It retails at $1,750, making it far cheaper to install the best hidden camera ever. Or, you know, just use a hotel. Or maybe it's just cheaper than hiring a private investigator?

		<title>Is DIY smart home tech hobbled by poor app functionality?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In Argus Insights' newest "Smart Home 360" report, it's clear there's a strong distinction between consumer perception of the apps associated with the most popular Smart Home Service Providers and MSOs (Multiple System Operators) and the apps coming with Do It Yourself (DIY) devices.

Argus Insights found that -- from over 56,000 app and device reviews -- <a href="http://www.adt.com/dallas?ecid=lmdallas&amp;optimizely_disable=true">ADT</a> and <a href="http://www.suddenlink.com/">Suddenlink</a> are the least liked of MSOs and service providers and their associated apps saw a drop in both the tone and volume of feedback over the last month, an indication that frustrated users could be moving to other providers.

This is consistent with <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/05/24/professionally-installed-home-automation-diy-pt1/">previous research</a> that demonstrates a high degree of satisfaction by customers in DIFM (“Do it for me”) installations.

However, <a href="http://support.vivint.com/product/skycontrol-mobile-app">Vivint’s Sky app</a>, Cox Communications Homelife app, Xfinity Home app and Alarm.com app all trended up -- an impact of both new releases and subscriber growth.

&nbsp;

[caption id="attachment_2619" align="aligncenter" width="322"]<img class="wp-image-2619 size-full" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/screen322x572-1.jpeg" alt="screen322x572" width="322" height="572" /> <em>Vivint's Sky App</em>[/caption]
<h2>A functionality gap?</h2>
The report reveals that the gap between consumer perception of the Smart Home devices they install and the apps use to control them persists, with the apps failing to deliver the promised functionality and usability. Connectivity continues to be a key barrier to adoption for most consumers, and home security continues to be the most discussed usage scenario by consumers both in the review data and in the more aspirational social conversations.

Users of the service provider apps that orchestrate their Smart Home experience have, in the last few months, seen the experience improve over the apps used to control those provided by device manufacturers like Nest and Philips.

This suggests that those offering “Do It For Me” experiences, especially after recent improvements by AT&amp;T, Vivint, Comcast and others, are beginning to best DIY experiences. This is mainly due to the fact that DIY experiences are still plagued with connectivity issues bleeding over from the initial installation of the devices in the home. Most of the issues for MSO and Service Providers are related to software quality issues such as app stability and constant bugs.

<em>See also: <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/05/24/professionally-installed-home-automation-diy-pt1/">Do we really want to DIY our home automation?</a></em>

However, both sets of users are frustrated with the performance of door lock and entry monitoring controls of their apps, mainly due to connectivity issues as data moves from door to gateway to cloud to phone and back again in a complex handoff of command and control. Connectivity issues like this can sometimes leave consumers fumbling for their keys after trying to use their phone.

Consumers are still more concerned about asset protection than having purple mood lights in the kitchen. While Amazon’s Echo continues to dominate as the most popular interface to the Smart Home, many consumers are still waiting to see if and when Apple starts to make good on the promise of HomeKit. T<a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/06/15/apples-home-makes-great-strides-connect-world-iot-apple-products-pt4/">he firm's recent announcements at WWDC makes us hopeful. </a>

Clearly there is a need for improvement in the home automation apps that are the conduit to any smart home. Without this, consumer dissatisfaction is sure to increase.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In October 2015, a refrigerator thermostat at <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/health/ci_28913345/bad-refrigerator-at-stanford-childrens-health-medical-office">Stanford Children's Health</a> failed, spoiling ten different types of vaccines and causing 1,500 kids to receive ineffective vaccinations. Unfortunately, failed thermostats are not an unusual issue and can cause ruined blood samples, vaccines and other important tests, costing millions of dollars and placing lives at risk.
<p class="more_overview">To prevent lost bio samples, hospitals are now turning to IoT-monitoring platforms which deploy sensors to alert hospital and lab administrators of temperature irregularities in real-time, helping them fix the problem before it starts.</p>

<h2>One solution to losing bio samples: connected thermostats</h2>
<p class="more_overview"><a href="http://datatoweb.com/">DataToWeb</a> is an IoT monitoring platform from the company based in Montreal, Canada, that reduces the risk of losses, facilitate the management of regulation complacency and reduce workload related for the management of temperatures in hospitals, laboratories and pharmacies by au<span class="morecontent">tomating temperature readings and alerting when there is a deviation.</span></p>
<p class="more_overview">I spoke to their CEO, Hakim Rouab, about their services. Like many startups, temperature regulation through IoT was not their original intention; rather, they pivoted from home energy monitoring.</p>
<p class="more_overview">Roubac was prosaic in admitting that it was great to being in a sector where we can provide a business solution to an identified problem. "We're bootstrapped. we are very happy because we struggled with energy monitoring and now we are very lucky to have found a business where customers pay for the service that we provide," he said.</p>
<p class="more_overview"><img class=" wp-image-2687 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/20151028_161157.jpg" alt="20151028_161157" width="654" height="368" /></p>
<p class="more_overview">In discussing the need for temperature monitoring, he said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="more_overview">"We've heard so many bad stories about what happens when a laboratory or hospital's fridges and freezers are not at the right temperature. 80% of our customers previous to our services, were having a person go around several times a day (usually between two and four) and manually check the temperature of each fridge or freezer.</p>
<p class="more_overview"> There are significant consequences if hospitals fail to meet basic monitoring standards, and they cannot operate if they do not monitor their supplies accurately. There's also the need in many instances to monitor room temperatures and humidity. Every time there is a big issue in hospitals, it is typically just before national holidays, we heard of an example when someone in maintenance just shut down the entire supply of Co2 for their incubators throughout the entire hospital."</p>
</blockquote>
<div>
<div> <img class=" wp-image-2688 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/20160525_090635-1024x576.jpg" alt="20160525_090635" width="762" height="429" /></div>
</div>
It's easy to predict a media outcry if patients realized the need for "do-over" tests due to incorrectly stored samples. Roubac noted:
<blockquote>
<div>"When someone has a liver biopsy or blood sample, you don't really want to ask 'Can you come back for another test, we had the throw the first one out!'"</div></blockquote>
DatatoWeb also has the advantage of being within the health industry but not subject to the restrictions of regulation due to the nature of their data. "We don’t store patient data, only machine data, so we don’t require all of the regulation around privacy of people" he explained. "Our system is safe to hacking, people cannot access data from our server."

I asked what would happen if their service failed, as technology is wont to do very occasionally.
<p class="more_overview">"We've used the services of  <a href="https://www.compose.io/">Compose</a> since 2015, we had problems with our previous databases, so we now use mongo DB," he replied. "Because this is an alert system, we really don't want to have downtime. We had downtime once with our previous database and it wasn't great. Luckily, our customers typically use back-up."</p>
<p class="more_overview">The next step for DatatoWeb is to scale their business outside of Canada and expand their customer base.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine a time when your retail purchases are curated, refined and personalized by your previous purchasing habits. You receive a package of ink in the mail when your printer runs low and a new toothbrush head just before it's time to change yours. This is the Commerce of Things, according to <span class="s1">James Gagliardi, Vice President of Strategy and Innovation at <span class="s2"><a href="http://www.digitalriver.com/">Digital River</a>, </span></span>and it's coming to your home and workplace.

I sat down and spoke to James about the role of e-commerce in the IoT space.

<strong>ReadWrite:</strong> How has the e-commerce platform geared towards IoT evolved?

<strong>James Gagliardi:</strong> Firstly, Digital River has been around for over 20 years. We're a multi-tenant e-commerce platform and services company. We’ve been cloud-based before cloud became a popular term for describing our capabilities. Over that period, we've seen the shift from digital downloads to subscriptions. First, it started with the anti-virus software company where you have to pay an annual fee in order to have your product updated. And now we’re moving to a space where we’re not just seeing annual subscriptions but monthly subscriptions, and companies are turning their products into services. For example, Abode Creative Cloud is now a subscription-based product.

We’re seeing a movement of companies creating products that are really platforms to deliver services (like smart devices) so your traditional company creating physical goods is now offering services and those services at some point need to be monetized . Here we've seen the entire space grow and evolve, not only from a tech standpoint but from a global perspective.

<strong>RW: So monetizing services is the key?</strong>

<strong>JG:</strong> Absolutely, it's about taking your smart product and monetizing. For example, Nest decided to stop making the Revolv smart home hub (which some people called <em>The Abandonment of Things</em>) but ultimately to me the main reason why they decided to end it was they didn’t have a strong monetization strategy in place for that product. Personally, I have over 50 connected devices in my house, from toothbrush to lightbulb to wearables, but they’re not monetizing those devices. I spent the $200 for the Nest product but that's all Nest (gets) in terms of getting dollars from me. With Revolv, customers were spending their $150, but there's a service behind the scenes of data analytics that essentially - with every customer they’re gaining - they’re also losing money because of the services they’re providing without monetizing.

Think of the Oral B smart toothbrush. It's connected and has the ability to provide feedback on how effective you are in brushing your teeth, effectively gamefying the brushing process. The problem they have is they don’t have the smart technology to say 'Hey, we know you’ve been brushing your teeth for twice a day for two minutes so now its time to replace the toothbrush head.' They haven't made the connection  to really provide that effective experience.

<em>Will Samsung's smart fridge be able to determine when our most purchased groceries run low and replenish supplies?</em>

<strong>RW: So, monetization, when utilized effectively, could really change the notion of repeat customers.</strong>

<strong>JG:</strong> Yeah, think of the cheap printers. They've historically been really cheap to buy, with the most money made on consumables like printer ink. The same rules can apply in this new world. For example, we have one customer that is offering a leased printer and are charging per print and for the printer cartridge.

If you are a keen runner with connected shoes, it means the shoe manufacturer will have the opportunity to provide feedback  based on your gait and stride in running and assist in buying the right pair of shoes, thus the data they acquire will improve the business to consumer relationship.

<strong>RW: What will the challenges be? Data security is a huge issue for many customers, especially if they are sharing it with retailers. </strong>

<strong>JG:</strong> It's a very legitimate big concern, especially in the case - for example - that Google, which owns Nest and variety of other connected devices, probably knows more about my habits than I do. I do think that there likely will be some backlash to this, and I think there will be some level of regulation that will need to happen. I can almost guarantee you that there will be a security breach of some of the data for one of these companies, whether it's your sleeping habits, how much you walk, and so on. So many people use wearables without contemplating what's happening with that data.

Short of that, if there's value coming back to the end customer, then people are probably going to be ok with shared data. Your mobile phone is probably the most invasive personal device that we could have, we are all basically are ok with that because of the benefit the mobile phone brings.

The downside is, again, these companies are trying to offer a service, a connection with the individual consumer unlike we’ve ever had before. Even if I bought my Fitbit at Best Buy or from Fitbit directly, I still have a relationship with Fitbit because I register the product with them. The downside of all this is the sheer number of relationships that I have to maintain, hence  the number of companies that I have to store my credit card information with, where I’m being charged incremental amounts. At some point there will be an overburdening amount of passwords and management that will need to be addressed.

<strong>RW: Lastly how will e-commerce look in, say, 20 years?</strong>

<strong>JG:</strong> E-commerce will look completely different. The amount of analytics, personalization, and predictive analysis means we will be in a more predictive state than today. Even with traditional impulse buys, they will be determined by our previous shopping history, like "We think  you’ll like this product so we're going to ship it to you." Also obviously VR and AR will come further into play. I still think there will still be bricks-and-mortar locations, people still like the art of discovery, but when I walk into a store, it knows who I am, and I will get specific offers and recommendations, features and feedback.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wearable devices and fitness programs share one thing in common: The problem of stamina.

It's well established that while fitness programs and the wearing of fitness wearables are enthusiastically embraced, both receive a drop-off after three months or less.  This is compounded by the fact that, so far, <span class="s1">there's been a proliferation of human performance data in the market, but a lack of understanding about what the data means and what to do with it. </span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://www.teamexos.com/">EXOS</a> is a human performance company that trains elite athletes, such as the likes of Russell Wilson, Andrew Luck, and German National Soccer team. They also conducted a study with the U.S. national soccer team that investigated the <a href="http://sports.usatoday.com/2014/06/05/sleep-monitors-us-players-brazil/">relationship between sleep and performance</a>. The company helps prepare hundreds of college players for the NFL every year, and it built on this program by reaching a deal with the NFL Players Association to provide lifestyle services to current and former players that deal with health, wellness, and life after football.  They also are heavily engaged in the development of corporate wellness programs across a range of Fortune 500 companies. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their roots </span><span class="s1">lie in understanding sports performance and human biomechanics through data – through groundbreaking scientific methodology. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With that in mind, they announced a partnership with Intel in March this year -- the first of its kind -- with the aims to:</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Track fitness data using Intel’s line of wearable products</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Provide actionable plans for consumers using the data and EXOS’ methodology</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Analyze corporate wellness environments to correlate wellness and productivity</span></li>
</ul>
EXOS is currently launching new education courses designed for fitness professionals, focusing on behavior upgrades and wearables data collection. This includes the first in a series of EXOS Presents courses, in collaboration with Intel, on wearables data. <a href="http://courses.teamexos.com/data-and-recovery/?utm_source=readwrite&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=pr">The initial course focuses on leveraging data to help facilitate recovery</a>.

<h2>EXOS: Time to bring insight to data</h2>
I spoke to Craig Friedman, VP of Performance Innovation at EXOS, about the program. He explained that the explosion of wearables on the market meant that:
<blockquote>"What used to be available in a research lab is now available on your wrist. The challenge is that data interest wears off if you don’t bring insight and context to it. We need to work on how should we be thinking, categorizing and leveraging data to bring insight, context and individualized prescriptions".</blockquote>
He also noted "the first step the industry hasn’t solved yet is creating a device nod giving the user a reason to use it for more than three weeks."

Many sports wearable companies focus their products on those already interested in their physical fitness and quantified self whether elite athletes or keen amateurs. Friedman also explained that measuring performance can be relevant to all of us in different doses:
<blockquote>"We can measure the athlete with the world record in broad jump-an example of total body power- but if we can’t generate enough power to stand out of our chair unassisted we can’t step off the toilet so our physical performance has a very real consequence on our quality of life."</blockquote>
Data is also used outside of fitness in many workplaces and homes and could include for example, "the number of bugs per line of code or for a parent the number of quality interactions with their child over a week."

The use of workplace wearables and the ability to collect meaningful employee data has changed in purpose according to Friedman. I recall last year ago there was a lot of attention focused on BP's distribution of Fitbit fitness trackers to employees and their spouses with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33261116" target="_blank">activity points earning staff discounts on their health insurance premiums</a>.  Friedman stresses that there is a need to ensure that data focuses on a variety of activities in an ongoing way with a consideration of the individual beyond the quantified self, "Is  a healthier employee more happy, do they have more energy, do they stay more engaged?  Do they enjoy their job more?"

Whether such factors can truly be measured by wearable apps remains to be seen but there's certainly plenty of people willing to try.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's become well established that the blockchain has an almost infinite range of <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/01/06/new-blockchain-applications/">functional applications </a>outside of pure financial transactions. This is particularly pertinent when it comes to the Internet of Things where technology is being used to disrupt a range of traditional industries.

One example is cargo <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/03/08/flexport-tackles-freight/">freight</a>, an industry traditionally reliant on paperwork -- typically in triplicate -- including the physical couriering of documents as proof of purchase. As well as being incredibly wasteful such a process caused problems in document authentication, payments, time delays and couriering not the mention the risk of losing of physical documents.

<em>See also: <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/05/09/blockhain-new-ir/">Will blockchain drive the fourth industrial revolution?</a></em>

One team has found a novel way to address these inefficiencies and authenticity challenges through the blockchain.  In January Dominik Schiener and his team won first prize at the <a href="http://www.blockchainlabs.org/blockchain-hackthon-en/" target="_blank">Shanghai Blockchain Hackathon</a> for their project <a href="https://github.com/domschiener/cargochain/tree/master/presentation">Cargochain</a>. We saw their work recently here in Berlin where they won the silver medal at the <a href="http://gtec.berlin/announcing-the-shortlist-for-the-gtec-blockchain-innovation-award/">GTEC Blockchain Innovation Awards</a> and I met with Dominik to learn more about it.

<strong>ReadWrite: How did your interest in the block chain and IoT come about?</strong>

Dominik Schiener: Like with most people, it started in 2012 when I first heard and read about Bitcoin. The concept behind Bitcoin intrigued me and I wanted to get involved. I started out with mining but then moved on to create my own startups in Switzerland and the UK. For the past year I’ve been mainly focusing on smart cities and how to combine Blockchain and IoT to create new, decentralized platforms that can spawn powerful applications. For me, smart cities consist of two core elements: participatory innovations and Internet of Things. Both of these can be enabled through blockchain and it’s what we’re working on.

<strong>RW: Can you describe IOTA? What do you see as its main applications?</strong>

DS: IOTA is a distributed ledger that can be used for transactional settlements as well as data transfers. Because of the properties of IOTA -- namely, its scalability, lightweight-ness and lack of transaction fees - it’s the perfect solution for the Internet of Things. We see IOTA as an enabler and the backbone of the "Machine Economy," as it enables all of these new machine interactions that were previously impossible. Not only can machines pay each other for the first time, but they can also communicate with each other and transmit data securely through a distributed ledger.

<strong>RW: The blockchain is commonly criticized for being slow and costly, especially with examples like the bitcoin blockchain, and counter to typical scalable database technologies. How does IOTA differ from this or respond to these issues?</strong>

DS: The main technological innovation of IOTA is the Tangle, which is a completely new Blockchain design that gets rid of the blocks and introduces a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) (NOTE: you can read the whitepaper on this technology at <a href="http://iotatoken.com/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf">http://iotatoken.com/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf</a>). The way the Tangle achieves consensus is entirely self-regulating. This means that consensus is no longer decoupled as with today’s blockchains. Because of this, IOTA is scalable, it is no longer limited to 10-minute block times and most notably, there are no transaction fees. This makes IOTA a perfect solution for machine-to-machine interactions that need to be able to send tiny nano-payments to pay each other for certain services.

In addition to this, IOTA is also quantum proof. This makes IOTA the first quantum proof distributed ledger in this space - which by itself, is an extraordinary technological achievement. IOTA all-around introduces novel new concepts to the space and it is arguably the most innovative project in this space since <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>.

<strong>RW: Where did the idea for CargoChain come from? Who is behind the project and what stage is it at?</strong>

DS: The initial concept behind CargoChain was initiated about six months ago, when I was researching what I wanted to develop for the Shanghai Blockchain Hackathon. As is nearly always the case in the blockchain space, you’re looking from an outsider’s perspective to figure out where blockchain can be applied to. So it was really about finding an existing problem that can be solved through blockchain.

The interesting thing about international trade is that the more I read into it, the more I realized how vastly outdated the industry really is and how, through blockchain and IoT, we can have a serious impact to improve it from the ground up.

Since then  -- I ended up winning the Shanghai Blockchain Hackathon with this concept -- we have been working more deliberately on how to combine IoT and blockchain and create a new platform for international trade. We also won the Technology Challenge of the Emirates National Bank of Dubai in April and last month we placed second at GTEC. Right now, we’re on-boarding partners to trial our first "proof of concept" this summer.

<strong>RW: Industries like shipping and manufacturing are quite traditional, not to mention fond of paper trails. How will you sell the concepts of CargoChain to them?</strong>

DS: It’s really about creating a product that is ten times better than what is currently being offered. Our initial strategy is focused on collaborating with larger corporations to run proof -of-concepts with their supply chains so that we gain hands-on insight and also recognition. Our product development is very iterative, and we want our product to be really shaped by the industry so that we can create something that solves problems for all of the stakeholders involved in the trade right now.

<strong>RW: What’s next for you?</strong>

DS: Right now our main focus is on IOTA, since it’s a foundational element of many of the products we have in mind, including CargoChain. IOTA will launch within a month and we intend to establish an entire new ecosystem for IoT and Blockchain use cases through IOTA. We’re quite excited about that and hope to get more startups and corporations involved in shaping this ecosystem. For CargoChain, we intend to run a public proof-of-concept running by Summer.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's not often you hear of a start-up product that emerged from a student working in a car factory.

But ProGlove's co-founder Paul Günther's foray into the startup world was preceded by employment at BMW. During his studies, he was in touch daily with workers on the factory floor. One thing was clear -- everyone wore gloves and if these gloves could be made intelligent, they could assist the worker to make their job easier.

ProGlove develops smart gloves that enable manufacturing and logistics staff to work faster, safer and easier. Process steps can be documented handsfree and the smart glove gives instant feedback to its user.

Current applications include the hands-free scanning of goods, monitoring and training of workflow sequences, identification of tools and parts to avoid incorrect usage, and documentation of goods and processes. ProGlove has successfully closed its first funding round of $2.2 million in late May, led by Intel Capital, GETTYLAB and Bayern Kapital to support the company as it prepares to launch its smart glove system.

I met with marketing manager, <span class="s1">Tarek Ouertani, to learn more. </span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3113" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/pro_glove_0184_gysmzx.jpg" alt="pro_glove_0184_gysmzx" />
<h2>ProGlove seeing a lot of trade fair interest</h2>
The Munich-based company was founded in December 2014 after coming third in the Intel “Make It Wearable” Challenge with the goal to bring wearables in industry environment and make the worker ready for Industry 4.0.

The glove is based on Intel’s wearables development module Edison and the win came with a helpful $140,000, funds which enabled the founders to delve into hardware prototyping.  Ouertani explained that the gloves are custom-created for factories and workshops where products are assembled by hand.

Each glove connects over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and includes a rechargeable battery. Every ProGlove combines motion sensors, RFID scanning, and visual and haptic feedback to create a wearable that can be used to train new employees and automatically document a worker’s progress.
<blockquote>"The use of the ProGlove leads to more efficient processes and processes that lead to more quality, the main drivers of the automotive industry. A good example is when I talked to a worker on the factor floor that was building a small car component that required the assembly of 48 different parts. Each of these had to be sourced, and scanned individually before assembly. He realized that some parts were missing but didn't know which ones. With the glove, the barcode scanning function means that workers are logging each individual component in order during assembly, meaning they are alerted if they make a mistake or leave something out."</blockquote>
Ouertani noted that there had been a lot of interest in the ProGlove at industrial trade fairs, with people saying "Ooh there's these guys with a glove so you don't have to scan with a scanner or a bulky ring on your finger." The glove retails at around $1,300 and includes the access point, module and charger.

It's also being tested for online retailers where it can be in an efficient tool in logistical areas such as inbound logistics, packaging and palleting where workers need to handle goods with both hands and stopping to pick up a scanner constantly is an inefficient use of time.

Ouertani explained that the glove could also solve the issue of documentation in a range of sectors, including the health industry:
<blockquote>"We're involved in a research project in health care looking at the needs of personal care attendants. They typically have 30 minutes per patient including washing, dressing and administering medication and part of this process can involve over ten minutes of documenting what they have done. Having a glove to document the steps they have completed means they get an additional ten minutes with their patient, doing their actual work rather than paperwork."</blockquote>
I was curious to learn about their challenges as a European hardware startup. As Ouertani said:
<blockquote>"As a hardware industrial startup, you need more money in the early stages, before your product is market-ready and this can be difficult. Here in Germany, investors are not easy to convince to take a risk with hardware. By comparison, investors in the US take more risks."</blockquote>
However there are distinct advantages to running a hardware start up in Germany. "We make products for the automotive industry and there are so many car factories and warehouses situated here, so it's been great to have easy access to our sector and go visit these places to test things."

The ProGlove is manufactured locally, which ensures quality control over each glove. And that emphasizes the need for manufacturing talent here to make the gloves not just to be customers. Ouertani noted:
<blockquote> "We think that nevertheless how many automatic processes you put in, workers are still a crucial part of the industrial process. Robots cannot substitute everything and wearables devices can be the connection point between humans and systems."

		<title>How to make air pollution measurement more accurate</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[IoT is putting itself forward as a means of tackling one of the world's biggest health problems: air pollution.

A problem that is not limited to developing countries but stills plagues some of the biggest cities in Europe. Just last year the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35689427">UK High Court ruled</a> that the government must take action to cut pollution after being in breach of EU limits for pollutants for several years with nitrogen pollution from diesel vehicles a significant contributing factor.

IoT is playing a key role in measuring and mapping pollution levels, with sensors and wearables used to record not only measurements but physiological responses to them. Many of these tools are made accessible to citizen scientists to create pollution maps within cities and are an important tool in  documenting and leveraging health and environmental data to inform public policy.

So here are some of the innovative technologists working hard in this space:
<h2>Idea 1: Aircasting</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-3598 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/AirCasting-Pod-and-App.jpg" alt="AirCasting-Pod-and-App" width="600" height="425" />

AirCasting is an <a href="https://github.com/habitatmap">open-source</a>, end-to-end solution for collecting, displaying, and sharing health and environmental data using a smartphone. The platform consists of wearable sensors that detect changes in your environment and physiology, including a palm-sized air quality monitor called the <a href="http://www.takingspace.org/aircasting/airbeam/">AirBeam</a>, the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.llp.aircasting&amp;hl=en">AirCasting Android app</a>, the AirCasting website, and <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/AirCasting-LiteBeam/">wearable LED accessories</a>.

Interestingly, as addition to measuring environmental levels such as Aircasting's wearable accessories can also measure the wearer's response to the air pollution including their heart rate, heart rate variability and breathing rate.
<h2>Idea 2: Airly</h2>
<img class="wp-image-3603 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/3-1-259x300.jpg" alt="3 (1)" width="541" height="627" />

Poland-based startup <a href="http://airly.pl/">Airly</a> is working on hardware that measures pollution (e.g. dust sensors, forest fires detectors, traffic management modules, water quality monitoring) so companies can deliver global solutions for Smart Cities. Their idea originated due to the founders' experiences the bad air of Krakow, considered the <a href="http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2015/06/25/polands-smog-crisis-europes-most-polluted-country-in-trouble-with-the-eu-but-wont-cut-coal-emissions/">most polluted city in Europe</a> due to coal emissions.

It's a made-to-order product that may be in its early days -- but instead of using Wi-Fi or GSM, it uses <a href="https://www.lora-alliance.org/What-Is-LoRa/Technology">LoRa</a> technology to power its sensor technology. They're working with Cisco to include environmental health as a just one of the data readings made possible in smart city technologies being made available to city governments. This startup is definitely one to watch.
<h2>Idea 3: Plumelabs</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-3323 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/CdhVm1HW4AAWzpK-1.jpg" alt="CdhVm1HW4AAWzpK" width="600" height="360" />
In March this year, Paris based startup <a href="https://www.plumelabs.com/">Plumelabs</a> set free a small flock of racing pigeons through London wearing pollution-sensing backpacks for three days to monitor the city's air pollution levels, particularly nitrogen dioxide and ozone gases -- produced mainly by diesel vehicles -- and reporting the results on Twitter.

The campaign encourages Londoners to join the "Air Patrol" by becoming beta testers for a wearable version of Plume Labs’ ultra-light air pollution sensing device. A<a href="http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/crowdsource-air-pollution-in-london"> crowdfunding campaign</a> aims at recruiting 100 beta testers in London to map out live air pollutant levels across the city. These personal wearable sensors will eventually complement Plume Labs’ flagship product, the Plume Air Report, an urban weather forecast for air pollution that tracks air pollution levels in 300 cities and 40 countries thanks to open data.

The free mobile app, available on iOS and Android, uses artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to provide live pollution forecasts and advice on what to do to avoid over-exposure to environmental factors such as UV or air pollutants.
<img class="size-large wp-image-3321 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/CdsOCX1XEAA7YkT.jpg" alt="CdsOCX1XEAA7YkT" width="600" height="360" />
The data collection of pollution levels is only one tool in creating a reduction of pollution in the cities of Europe. The introduction of laws to reduce the reliance on old technologies is one way to create this incentive to boost new technologies that remove pollutants from the atmosphere. Electric cars are one example of this technology, yet their adoption needs to move beyond financial incentives.

Some researchers cautiously claim that <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/driverless-cars-may-slow-pollution/">driverless cars will reduce pollution</a>, with others cite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/07/tesla-3-electric-car-affordable-worth-price">the popularity of the Tesla 3 </a>as an example that electric cars can be a viable consumer option. With all this innovation, it will be interesting to see if and how pollution levels changes over the next decade.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While the media buzz around wearables has died down somewhat, due in part to the noise of VR and AR, they still have a place to play.

I live in Germany where <em>Fußball</em> -- you call it soccer or football -- is the national passion. Every<em> spati, </em>or convenience store, and bar and cafe for miles has hired a big screen television, invariably situated outside surrounded by tables of beer drinking. Amongst the paraphernalia, there's a slew of devices in operation in both bring the game closer to fans and tracking and improving the performance of players.

In April this year, the third workshop of the Electronic Performance Tracking Systems (EPTS) expert group took place. The participants represent top leagues, professional clubs and national teams, as well as the <a href="http://www.theifab.com/#!/home">IFAB</a> (International Football Association Board) and <a href="http://www.fifa.com/index.html">FIFA</a> (Fédération Internationale de Football Association).

The aim of the expert group is to develop a global standard for EPTS devices, including wearable technology systems. The IFAB approved the use of EPTS devices in principle in March 2015 and gave FIFA’s Football Technology Innovation Department the mandate to develop a global standard for such devices.

Then in July 2015, FIFA <a href="http://resources.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/02/66/27/59/circularno.1494-approvalofelectronicperformanceandtrackingsystem(epts)devices_neutral.pdf">issued a memorandum</a> approving the use of  wearable electronic performance and tracking systems in matches.

Here are some of the ways wearables are bringing advanced analytics to football.
<h2>Intelligent shin pads</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-3997 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/shinguard-3-350px.jpg" alt="shinguard-3-350px" width="350" height="356" />

Spanish carbon fiber company<a href="http://en.carbures.com/"> Carbures </a>has created "intelligent" shin-pads made up of a sensor system and carbon fibre parts for the uniform of the Spanish national football team. An built-in sensor system registers personalized information for each player in every match  -- including the amount of hits received and the strength of each hit -- creating a unique profile for each player. They also assist the team manager when making decisions for matches. The shin-pads register all the data relative to the performance of the players in the playing field, for instance, with which leg they kick the ball, the speed of the hit, the distance travelled in the match or during part of the game, offering key data to the technical staff.

It was revealed at CES last year that the German national squad wore adidas' miCoach technology during training sessions before and during the World Cup in Brazil. Darcy Norman, a performance data analyst with the German national team revealed that the data would be analyzed after training sessions to see how exactly each athlete performed. Coaches then used the information to plan future workouts more effectively and make better personnel decisions. “We quantify the training sessions to get some benchmark to then have meaningful conversations,” said Norman, when we <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/06/07/exos-and-intel-bring-meaning-to-wearables-data-vt4/">spoke </a>earlier this year.

<h2>Smart leggings</h2>
<p class="font_8"><img class="wp-image-4094 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/20160222_132656_HDR-1024x576-1024x576.jpg" alt="20160222_132656_HDR-1024x576" width="694" height="391" /></p>
<p class="font_8">Earlier this year at Mobile World Congress, <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/">Qualcomm</a> introduced a smart clothing prototype, <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/snapdragon/2016/02/29/snapdragon-powers-winning-devices-mobile-world-congress">smart leggings</a> with five sensors packed into the ankle, knee and base of the spine of the clothing. The sensors enable data to be sent over Bluetooth to a smartphone in real-time which could provide a team manager with insight about the positioning of multiple players as well as track data about their physical condition which could assist in player formation decisions and the like. It is only a prototype now but could be a useful tool in the future.</p>

<h2>And...smart football boots?</h2>
<img class="wp-image-4049 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/F50_MICOACH_RT3-1024x682.jpg" alt="F50_MICOACH_RT3" width="678" height="452" />

Are smart football boots the one form of wearables that are noticeably absent? In 2011, Adidas released <a href="http://www.adidas.de/micoach-speed_cell-bluetooth-smart-kompatibel/G75090.html">speed cell</a>, a device that clipped into the sole or lacing of football boots. It was designed to store up to 50 unique workouts with a corresponding apps.

The chip uses intelligent sensors to detect when the user is performing their activity and can capture 360° movement and measure speed, average speed, maximum speed, number of sprints, distance travelled, distance at high intensity levels and stride rates. However, it seems to be a product before its time with consumer reviews detailing connectivity and battery problems as late as 2015.

No one company has come up with smart football boots that have been played in football matches. However at Tech World 2016 this year in China, Lenovo unveiled<a href="http://news.lenovo.com/news-releases/lenovo-unveils-smartphones-that-reshape-whats-possible-vision-for-connected-devices-at-tech-world-2016.htm"> a smart sports shoe prototype </a>that contains an Intel Curie wearable chip. It contained the ability to count steps and tracks calories burned, lights up along the bottom, and contains a customizable 3D-printed insole. It can also charge wirelessly if placed it on a shoe-sized charging panel. Could it be the beginning of smarter shoes?

Ultimately, we can't yet say that wearables are the difference between winning and losing a football match. But their role in training cannot be ignored, especially as data analytics is used to improve the fitness and skills of both individual players and teams as a whole. It'll be interesting to see who is in the final and whether their wearables are revealed.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>

It's clear that fans feel a real connection to their sports teams. What if a wearable device could celebrate that connection? One company, Wearable Experiments (We:eX), has created a new wearable just in time for the 2016 Euro Cup, the <a href="http://wearableexperiments.com/football/">Football Fan Shirt</a>.

It's embedded with haptic technology that connects fans in real-time to action in the game through touch. According to the company:
<blockquote>"Using the <em>skin</em> as an interface, we are able to transmit plays from the game directly to the wearer using choreographed haptic feedback. This creates a heightened sense of excitement blurring the lines between player and spectator. As well as connecting fans to fans and capturing the data from fan excitement."</blockquote>
The Football Fan Shirt is connected to an app, where you can select which team you want to follow.

By harnessing real-time game data, this allows the wearer to feel the sensations of what the team is going through with every major play, as it happens on the pitch -- including red card, penalties, offsides, shots off goal and the celebration of scoring goals.

</div>
<div>I spoke to co-founder, director, and designer Billie Whitehouse, who was in France for the Euro Cup, about their journey in wearables and what inspired them to create wearables for football fans.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Whitehouse explained her entree into connected clothing:</div>
<div>
<blockquote>"My background is design education and I was researching emerging technologies, from 3D printing to software solutions, for a means of how people were interacting and consuming content and I become reasonably good at the language and communication style. When an agency came to me about designing underwear, I had no idea how to build it but I just knew what was possible and that was just the beginning for us, we knew we were doing some something interesting and having a really good time doing it and there was enough challenge and enough to drive us to create a business."</blockquote>
The underwear was called <a href="http://wearableexperiments.com/fundawear/">Fundawear </a>for condom brand Durex and it was a prototype that that allows physical touch to be transferred wirelessly between couples and recreated on their skin. It sends real touch from one smartphone to another and from there to mini sensors inside the Fundawear garments, so couples can tantalize each other - even when they are apart.

</div>
<h2>Everyday wearable clothes not yet the norm</h2>
I was curious to see what developments Whitehouse had seen in the wearables sector since their first product was created. It's an space which is dominated by high fashion wearables for one-off events like the <a href="http://www.vogue.com/tag/event/met-gala/">Met Gala</a> and clothing that is more likely to be worn down a catwalk and never seen again, or hung to languish in a museum or gallery more for its creative capabilities than its purpose as a connected device. Few wearables go to market and can be bought easily.

Whitehouse commented:
<blockquote>
<div>"What is important to remember is it's such a new industry that you got to make it big to make people listen and thats what those products are doing. They are building brand awareness, they’re building their audience. There's one company making wearables called <a href="http://electrofur.com/">Electro Fur</a> targeting people that go to Burning Man. People buy these hideous furry light up things and they are in this respect extremely successful so depends what community you are looking at for commerciality. But we do want to do a commercial product we don’t just want to be a one-off."</div></blockquote>
<div>

We:Ex have previously ventured into shirts for sports fans with the <a href="http://wearableexperiments.com/alert-shirt/">Alert Shirt</a>, a fan jersey that uses wearable technology to take the experience into the physical world, allowing fans to feel what the players feel live as it happens during the game. It featured haptic feedback motors that were able to give the sensation of touch to those watching the game.

The idea is for every hit, touchdown, kick, or shove, viewers will get a sensation of how the players are feeling at that exact moment. This works by sending information from the players themselves  -- who are wearing almost a reverse version of the Alert Shirt -- to a central hub, which then analyzes and compounds that data, before sending it out to all Foxtel app users and transferring that information into haptic feedback via the shirt.

Whitehouse explained that:
<blockquote>"Since then we’ve got better and better and better at doing this. The first version, back in 2014, was removable electronics and rechargeable by USB — and encapsulated in medical grade silicon and we had to build an infrastructure inside the shirt to house all of these things. What we’ve got better at is the enabling technology so actually encapsulating it in fibers and that's taken a long time. We've learnt about the placement of the sensors in terms of building the most emotional experience for a fan, purely for the audience to feel more connected to the players. The intensity and frequency of the vibrations that are connected to the emotional feedback, we’ve just got so much better at it, because we learnt from all those other changes. This time around I think we’ve actually nailed it, it really does feel like a heartbeat, it really does feel like a build-up of intensity when you’re about to get a penalty or someone gets a red card."</blockquote>
<div>

Yet, We:Ex is yet to bring a product to the retail market.  When I asked about the retailing of the Fan Shirt, Whitehouse said:
<blockquote>
<div> "Our whole point of being here is to see how people react to them, we want to see how people respond. We had a booth at Cannes Lions talking to hundreds of people asking 'what does it mean to you, would you tie your brand to it, is there a sponsorship revenue model here?' and also some of the bigger teams and leagues at the forefront of the fourth dimension of entertainment. So we’re just having conversations right now."</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div><img class="size-full wp-image-4107 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/euroFAN_2309.jpg" alt="euroFAN_2309" width="300" height="450" /></div>
<div>Whitehouse also reveals that their potential market may be different to who they might have earlier anticipated:</div>
<blockquote>
<div>"We've found that women and children really love this product. I didn't think of the children factor until we did these events last week, 40% of all Manchester United fans are between the age of 8 and 19 and they are the demographic really into this…the really old, religious fans tend to be like, 'oh I’m not going to buy another jersey, i already have the team one'. That’s been really interesting."</div></blockquote>
<div>  Whitehouse concedes that their journey has been a challenging one:</div>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote>"Retail is pretty dire and marketing invisible technology is difficult. If you have a creative mind-set it's certainly not a no-go, there are so many interesting, beautiful ways to get around it, but it's a new way of talking to consumers that I don’t think people have really experienced before. It's simple, this is what I know, I come from a fashion background, and marketing it is the part of the next stage, and that's what I am excited about, there is no one way how to do this and anyone that says there is, is really really ignorant for there's so many exciting ways…you have to be a bit crazy to want to do it."</blockquote>
</div>
Crazy or not, We:Ex has had an interesting journey and it will be interesting to see how they progress in the future.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In an era where sporting games can be beamed into one's home via tv or internet subscription with curated footage without the need to battle car parking, queues, expensive tickets, unhealthy fast food or poor viewing seats, it's clear that sports stadiums need to offer something radical to entice fans away from their home comforts. Stadiums around the world are stepping up to the plate to provide  superior services to both fans, players and staff through connected technology.

Here are some examples:
<h2>The rise of the Connected Stadium</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-4124 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/article-1284597-0AF89E3B000005DC-158_468x286-1.jpg" alt="sports" width="468" height="286" />

The "Connected Stadium" is a concept where stadiums facilitate the audience's ability interact online from within the stadium, and within this to interact with the online community whether via tablet or mobile. To achieve this, stadiums are increasingly committed to providing fast, reliable WiFi to enable fans to engage with their broader social media connections.

Finding a parking space and the right entrance to your seat can be difficult at a new stadium. There's now a suite of apps, including <a href="https://www.justpark.com/uk/parking/broadfield-stadium/">Just Park</a>, that sell parking spaces and guide you not only to the stadium but your seat.

&nbsp;

<img class="size-large wp-image-4125 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/03-barcode-580x1024.png" alt="03-barcode" width="580" height="1024" />

Fans no longer need to jostle overfilled cups of beer and messy hot dogs between the kiosk and your seat, risking a spill with every step. Many stadiums have rolled out <a href="http://www.emobilepos.com/solutions/stadium-arena-pos/">mobile point of service systems</a> to enable fans to buy food, beverages, merchandise and team memberships <a href="http://www.bypassmobile.com/">without even leaving their seat</a> through a combination of mobile and beacon technology.

It not only saves time, but also lowers staffing needs. Along with merchandise, sports stadiums an also make extra money through the up-selling of seats through the use of seat upgrade apps such as <a href="https://www.pogoseat.com/">Pogoseat</a> which enable fans to move to seats closer to the action during the game for a price which reduces as the game progresses.  Geomapping also helps provide fans with information via mobile app on the nearest bathrooms and the expected wait time.
<h2>Cisco's real-time live feeds</h2>
Cisco's <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/solutions/industries/docs/sports/broncos-sports.pdf">StadiumVision</a> initiative delivers real-time, live HD video from any source and can include content from in-house feeds and external local and national channels create an exciting, immersive experience for fans throughout the venue. An example is the <a href="http://www.sportsauthorityfieldatmilehigh.com/">Sports Authority Field</a> at Mile High in Denver which hosts 1,200 displays. Large video walls offer a lasting impression and support complementary sidebar promotions and ads for the local team, the Broncos. Fans can also access a range of tools such as player profiles, statistical data and fantasy performances of teams on their smart phones, tablets and stadium kiosks.

This has an add-on effect of servicing sponsors, says Brady Kellogg, vice president of corporate partnerships for the Broncos:
<blockquote>“In addition to keeping our fans engaged in all of the action throughout the stadium, we have so much more to offer sponsors. Now we can offer segmentation opportunities for advertisers, sponsors, concessionaires, and merchandising partners. Sponsors can reach a broader range of people through more brand touch points and tailor specific messages to specific levels of fans.”</blockquote>
<h2>Getting to know your fans</h2>
Smart stadiums can personalize the fan experience through <a href="http://www.rippleffect.com/news-views/the-connected-stadium-what-can-football-learn-from-erm-football/">loyalty programs</a> based on their purchase history and through data analytics software that is used to predict future behavior -- what they buy and when. Retail franchises can maximize on this information as they are able to communicate with fans from the time of their arrival and during the game, during which they can send targeted ads and personalized messaging.

Goal-line technology  is an integral part of match officiating at smart stadiums and is used in events such as the <a href="http://www.uefa.org/mediaservices/mediareleases/newsid=2354960.html">2016 Euro Cup.</a> One example is the the <a href="http://www.hawkeyeinnovations.co.uk/sports/football">Hawk-Eye</a> system that deploys seven cameras per goal, using control software to track the ball within the goal area. Using vision-processing techniques and software, Hawk-Eye indicates whether or not a goal has been scored within one second with a vibration and visual signal on each match official's watch. This is supplemented by an extra official behind each goal-line.
<h2>Stadium crowd management</h2>
Smart stadiums can also benefit staff and officials through<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ibm/2015/05/04/how-smart-digital-stadiums-are-changing-the-way-we-watch-sports/#57787cf4c1c2"> accurate real time data</a> such as the number of people present and their locations, tools that are useful in case of an emergency or a missing child. Smart surveillance can also be utilized to provide safety evacuation information such as instructions and directions in the case of an emergency and analytics can be coordinated with weather and traffic information outside of the stadium. This means fans can leave happy, with the knowledge of their fastest route home.

Attending a game is not a cheap activity. As more and more stadiums embrace technology and the inevitable costs involved, the challenge will be to mitigate the increased costs: would fans rather be saving money for tickets if it means they are subject to constant marketing -- personalized or otherwise?  Time will tell if stadiums are able to balance the competing priorities of fans and marketers.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Buddy Platform brings new meaning to old IoT data</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While it's easy to get caught up with all the bells and whistles of autonomous car development and home automation, I firmly contend that some of the most exciting things in IoT are innovations that are transforming traditional industries like viticulture, shipping, agriculture and manufacturing. The companies responsible don't always become household names but they are busy behind the scenes creating quiet revolutions.

One example of these is <a href="https://buddy.com/">Buddy Platform</a>, a Seattle-based company with a global platform for accessing and analyzing data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, appliances and sensors.

I spoke with Buddy Platform CEO Dave McLauchlan recently about their latest developments to learn more.

He explained their purpose in a nutshell:
<blockquote>"Our thesis is that we are seeing an enormous volume of IoT data generated by companies that have never really had to manage large volumes of data before like dishwasher companies and garage door opener companies and car manufacturers. These companies need to know how to manage their data, secure it, and get access to it.

We are a platform for that data to come in raw,  in whatever form venerated (e.g. from a sensor or a device that has a bunch of sensors). We can shape it, process and store it securely. We can also perform real time queries on that data, e.g. 'How many cars with more than 18,000 miles on the clock have break levels of less than X and engine temperatures of greater than Y?' Then we can perform actions based on real time queries. An example is water management - if a query triggers a leak, then we can send a control signal back to a device  such as 'if water level greater than x then send an off signal to the water pump'. That can all be handled in real time on our platform at very large scale. Hence, customers have all the benefit from owning the data and the learnings that come from the data generated by connected devices but they don’t have to manage the infrastructure, or scale it or maintain it or even evolve the platform as technologies evolve."</blockquote>
Buddy transforms the expensive and labor-intensive process of collecting, managing and analyzing IoT big data into a fast, simple and real-time process. Buddy’s customers are in a range of sectors —  from airline, agriculture and automotive to robotics, telecom and government. and include Sears, <a href="https://lono.io/">Lono</a> and <a href="http://www.walottery.com/">Washington's Lottery</a>.

As well as their key business they're building out a fully hosted, fully managed, auto-scaling implementation of Parse Server targeted at higher volume applications. You'll remember <a href="https://parse.com/">Parse</a>, it was a service used by software developers to store and manage data in their apps that was originally owned by Facebook. They've also been working on the initiative <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/04/20/buddy-iot-impact-solve-flint-water-crisis-il4/">IoT for impact,</a> a call to action to  the IoT industry to together help solve -and even predict— emergency community crises.

Within IoT there's a dichotomy between the DIY and 'Do It For Me' camps in the IoT industry. I discussed this with McLauchlan who notes:
<blockquote>"We sell a solution directly to folks who don’t want to hire developers and build. more than half top 10 customers are folks that have gone and built their own IoT system and decided that's not really worth it on an economic basis. Our belief is that the hype curve in it is comfortably ahead of the reality curve and the middle American manufacturer -- like the washing machine manufacturer -- now they’ve got to worry about device data and securing information. They just want it solved and they want to be able to tell their customers that their data is secure. There's a very prominent role we can play there, the customers still own the data , can still use and derive value for it, we’re simply providing the mechanism for them to do so."</blockquote>
Buddy has recently announced intent to acquire IoT security and device management platform, <a href="https://www.zentri.com/">Zentri Inc</a>, a company that operates a Silicon-To-Cloud platform for product connectivity. The company’s platform comprises ZentriOS, an operating system (OS) purpose-built for commercial-grade IoT, as well as other ingredients to connect a client’s product, create a dashboard to manage and monitor in-field products, and build responsive mobile applications for customers.

As McLauchlan describes it:
<blockquote>"They've made an operating system that runs on top of commodity hardware with the idea being that by dropping software system onto the hardware you don’t have to go and write the software that will enable that hardware to become 1) Connected to the internet and 2) Securely connect to a mobile application or some mobile mechanism and 3) Being managed as one of a fleet of devices. Thus, with their software a customer can take commodity hardware and deploy that software and make that advice all ready to.  So if you were building washing machines, say a million a year, in terms of being able to check in on the fleet and their performance, push out software as necessary, all the block and tackle of how you manage these devices, all of this is what they do in their operating system.

We realized that there's almost perfect synergy that our customers were looking for a way to keep a track of 100,000 devices and their customers wanted to do more with the data. so we realized it was a really good opportunity."</blockquote>

<h2>Buddy also acquiring IoT buddies</h2>
Not a company to rest on their laurels, Buddy also announced intent to acquire <a href="http://www.noveda.com/smart-buildings">Noveda</a>, a company that  develops and provides Web-based energy monitoring solutions for conventional and renewable energy systems.

As McLauchlan explained:
<blockquote>"We saw an opportunity to dip our toe into the first vertical that we want to focus on, smart cities. Noveda have deployments across the US, Canada and the Middle East.  They take all the data generated by their customers, give it to us, we process it send it back to them and they use it to create dashboards of how buildings are performing in real time. They literally show these dashboards in buildings with smart meters and people can see how a building is consuming electricity, thus causing people to be more energy efficient."</blockquote>
Noveda's customers include Staples, the US federal government and public schools in New York City. Add these to the organizations already working with Buddy and Zentri and there's going to be a whole lot of meaning bought to IoT generated data through the work of this trio.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's easy with the evolution towards cars that are not only connected but autonomous vehicles to forget that such technologically enhanced vehicles are preceded by cars that have operated with perfect functionality for many years despite their lack of technical prowess.

Up until now, the owners of such cars have been faced with two options: remain "disconnected" or upgrade to a new car. Thanks to a Munich-based IoT company called ThinxNet, car owners with model years from 2001 onwards can get some of the technological advances afforded to those with newer car models.

The system is called <a href="https://www.tanktaler.de/">TankTaler</a>, and includes a hardware dongle  -- which includes a SIM card and GPS monitor -- and a corresponding smart phone app. The dongle plugs into the <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/obd-ii-port-used/">OBD II interface</a>,  the port located below the steering wheel that mechanics access to get diagnostic information about your car.

Once paired with the app, the car owner can get a range of information about the car, This includes battery and fuel levels, details of travel routes and driving behaviour, anti-theft protection and more. We spoke with Regina Werner at ThinxNet to learn more.
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UswbPJxiv1w" width="600" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h2>TankTaler concept actually came from the farm</h2>
TankTaler was launched in November 2015 after the ThinxNet founders pivoted from their original plan to use GPS technology to track the location of cow herd on large farms in the Alps or Argentina. The dongle and app are free for participants who additionally earn bonus points called TankTaler which can be redeemed in gift vouchers -- from gas stations or retailers like Amazon around Germany with loyalty program with cash-back system.

The TankTaler device offers a range of functionalities, that interest different people in different ways.  Werner explained:
<blockquote>"Some users want really simple features, for example, people who live in the cities often do not have a private parking lot, hence they spend hours looking for a place to park their car – and thus always park at different sites. Additionally, they often share cars. This means they never know where their car is parked. Then there's tech driven people  who are super interested in the statistics around the car such as the driving behaviour, how harsh they are breaking, how much they’re accelerating and the distances they’ve travelled. Then you have people that like using TankTaler as they like to save money".</blockquote>
Currently, they have about 25,000 customers, "the largest private fleet in Germany," mainly in Munich and Cologne. They generate revenues through partnerships with various companies including gas stations, garages, car dealerships, restaurants and retail chains; McDonald's and IKEA are both partners.
<h2>Discount benefits...and reclaiming your data</h2>
That means TankTaler users get discounts and other benefits. You can imagine there being some attractive connections with car insurances also. However, ThinxNet's work is underpinned with the idea of personal "sovereignty"<strong><em> </em></strong>over personal data. Werner notes that:
<blockquote>"Right now most car manufacturers are collecting data without drivers being aware of it and trying to earn money out of it. We believe that drivers should own their data and decide what to do with it, according to what will directly benefit them".</blockquote>
It also benefits people who use their car for business. As Werner explains:
<blockquote>"When you use your car also for business you get tax deductions according to your mileage but you have to document your journey in a log book. Through TankTaler people can download all their trips as a spreadsheet. By comparison, a competitor's product offering only this feature costs over €700".</blockquote>
<h2>TankTaler also enables payments</h2>
The dongle works without the need for a mobile phone connection. This has meant that it is possible to track the cars location precisely and get help in the event of a break down or accident as the device is connected to an emergency call number. <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/05/23/calm-cruel-connected-iot-hits-misses-may-vr1/">This is akin to the functions of the latest BMW motorcycles</a> and is expected to be made mandatory in all new cars by 2018.

ThinxNet are working to join forces with automobile clubs to enable the tracking of broken down cars with the app able to send their precise location. As the dongle has its own battery, it can send data even if the dongle is removed by a car theft or the car battery gets disconnected in the case of a crash.

Perhaps one of the most innovative uses of the TankTaler is in one touch payments at gas stations. Users can fill up, tap the app, and get back in their car. They are then sent a monthly bill to pay. This is very innovative for Germany where you normally have to pay inside the shop and many retailers favor cash over other payment methods. Werner notes:
<blockquote>"Gas station owners are sometimes 60-plus (years old) and hard to explain the technology to, but when you show that people can pay through the app, people think that's really revolutionary. Some owners are like 'This is the biggest revolution in the last 40 years in the industry.'"</blockquote>
But perhaps some of the more indirect benefits of TankTaler are through big data analysis.

The device has the potential to track large groups of drivers throughout concentrated areas and thus is able to measure the popularity of driving routes and determine weak spots where a road needs to be repaired or there's a spot with high rates of accidents.

This could potentially include information for smart city planners such as where to situate traffic lights and how to control them with the help of real time data to get a smooth flow of traffic. It can also help developers determine where gas stations should be built according to traffic flow.

ThinxNet intends on branching up to other parts of Europe in the upcoming months, paving the way for enter into other countries around the world. The irony of such an enterprise as this is that as connected cars become more normal, they will gradually be placing themselves out of a job, but for now, that time is a long way off.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Calm, cruel and connected: July’s best and worst of IoT</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems that every day a new IoT device or means to connect existing devices is revealed. With so much energy in being devoted to tell us how, when, where, what we can connect to each other, the “why” may be getting a little blurry. So we want to take a step back every now and<a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/05/01/best-and-worst-iot-week-vr1/"> take a critical look</a> at the connected devices that actually go out and buy, right now.

Here’s what caught our eye, for all the right – or wrong – reasons:
<h2>Smart Handbags</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-4548 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/md-for-press-rel-e1467066327414.jpg" alt="md-for-press-rel-e1467066327414" width="460" height="338" />
<p class="p1">While I'm not really the target market that lusts after luxury bags, I do know that if I was to purchase one, I would want proof that I was buying the real deal and not a cheap knock-off.</p>
<p class="p1">Electronics and smart systems company <a href="http://www.thinfilm.no">Thinfilm</a> recently announced a partnership with <span class="s1"><a href="http://www.mariadonato.com">Maria&amp;Donato</a>, a craftsman leather-goods manufacturer and provider of premium handbags. </span><span class="s1">The two companies are integrating Thinfilm’s NFC SpeedTaü tags into Maria&amp;Donato’s exclusive handbag collections to battle counterfeiting and address growing concerns of fraud within the broader luxury goods market. The smartphone-readable NFC tags will also enable consumers to learn more about the brand and the product, and purchase limited-edition handbags online.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SpeedTap tags are thin, flexible labels that integrate with a product’s packaging or label and can be read with the tap of an NFC-enabled smartphone. Each tag is uniquely identifiable and and is virtually impossible to clone. Once tapped, the tag wirelessly communicates with the cloud, instantly delivering authentication messaging, serial numbers, and other relevant content from the brand or manufacturer.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"> <strong>Verdict: Hit</strong></p>

<h2>KiBand</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-4552 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Kiband-Pink-983x1024-1.jpg" alt="Kiband-Pink-983x1024 (1)" width="666" height="613" />

Children running away from their parents is an everyday problem. When I lived in Australia it was not uncommon to see children on leashes to stop them running across the road. Now there's a wearable wanting to address this problem in a more technical way.

The <a href="http://kiband.com/">Kiband</a> is a wearable device designed for situations when children wander off in public places like parks, malls, grocery stores and public events. It's a wristband, or ankle band if you prefer, with a patent-pending internal locking mechanism. A corresponding app and the power of Bluetooth track a child's distance from a parent parent  -- up to about 200 feet -- and emit a 95-decibel siren, the equivalent to a fire alarm, if they stray too far.

It also notifies the parents if the band is submerged in water for more than a few seconds. Surely the Kiband's biggest failure, besides a sound fit to torture any human or animal in their vicinity, is that is does not utilize any tracking capabilities. The company admits that "Kiband’s goal is to prevent a lost child, not find a child after he or she is lost. GPS is not necessary in this application and ultimately lowers the cost of the product for you, the consumer."

However it's easy to imagine a willful child that would deliberately set off the alarm, making the much more peaceful child leash a far more appealing option. The product retails for <span style="line-height: 1.5;">$149 and is available on pre-order. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span>

<strong>Verdict: Miss</strong>
<h2>Elvie</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4554" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Elvie-product-shot-B.jpg" alt="Elvie-product-shot-B" width="845" height="748" />

<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19932408">Pelvic floor dysfunction</a> encompasses a range of health conditions that can affect up to 60% of women at a stage of life. <a href="https://www.elvie.com/">Elvie</a> is a wearable device that facilitates exercise therapy to successfully treat these conditions. It’s a connected pelvic floor exerciser worn internally short periods of time and gives the user real-time feedback as they undertake a series of pelvic floor exercises. This includes detecting if you are exercising incorrectly using motion sensors, while the force sensors measure the strength of your squeeze. Bluetooth connects to the app, allowing you to visualize each exercise.  Each device retails at $22o.

<strong>Verdict: Hit</strong>
<h2>Dubstein</h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-4680 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/dubstein_flask_5-1024x686.jpg" alt="dubstein_flask_5" width="1024" height="686" />

When people write articles about the utilization of "technology for technology's sake," I suspect this is the kind of devices they are thinking about. <a href="https://www.dubgear.com/">Dubstein</a> is dubbed by company Dubgear as "the world's first Bluetooth stereo speaker with beverage integration". Basically it's an insulated drink cozy that connects wirelessly via Bluetooth to  Smartphone, MP3 player, tablet or computer. Dubstein assures us that "your tunes have never tasted so good" It could be a fun novelty product except for the C$129 price tag. Maybe if it actually made me coffee I'd be more interested.

<strong>Verdict: Miss</strong>
<h2>Tree Wi-Fi</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-4549 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/TreeWifi-1020x610.jpg" alt="TreeWifi-1020x610" width="1020" height="610" />

<a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/06/27/iot-brings-accuracy-to-the-problem-of-air-pollution-tl1/">Air pollution </a>is one of the problems of modern society where the Internet of Things can be part of the solution. Amsterdam based start-up <a href="http://www.heroesandfriends.com/projects/treewifi">TreeWiFi</a>  are building birdhouses that measure air pollution and make the levels of pollution visible through an LED status light. Obviously visibility is only one part of the tools needed to fight pollution.

TreeWifi take this a step further. When the server detects an improvement in air quality, it allows the birdhouse to share it’s <a href="http://inhabitat.com/tag/wifi/">internet connection</a> with everyone in the street. Users that connect to the network get tips &amp; tricks on how to improve air quality locally before going online. It's an innovative way to tackle a problem where residential engagement can be difficult.

<strong>Verdict: Hit </strong>
<h2>Porkfolio</h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.wink.com/img/product/quirky-porkfolio-piggy-bank/variants/814434018865/hero_01.png" width="683" height="683" />

Moving to a country where cash is king and coins are still in existence has taken some getting used to. Getting rid of small change can be a challenge. But now there's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quirky-Porkfolio-Smart-Piggy-Black/dp/B00H0RFM9A">Porkfolio</a>, a smart piggy bank that enables you to track your balance and set goals through a corresponding app. The nose lights up each time a coin is added and I can see why at a glance,  this would be a good introductory product to get children interested in saving money.

But I'm not convinced coins are the future. I'd be more impressed if the pig converted coins to bitcoins or at least notes or took my money to the bank for me.

<strong>Verdict: Miss</strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A recent <a href="http://www.citihorizons.com/resources/lucy-zodion-white-paper">report </a>commissioned by streetlight design and manufacturing company <a href="http://www.lucyzodion.com/">Lucy Zodion</a> has found significant barriers to smart city development in the UK.

The report contains research into the opinions on smart cities of senior contacts from councils across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The in-depth interviews conducted in May and June 2016 gauged the appetite for smart cities among UK councils and opinions on a range of topics, from the biggest obstacles to smart cities to the most pressing priorities for councils.

It was revealed that the task of achieving smarter, more connected cities in the UK lies with local councils. With the National government’s drive for devolution, they are placing the responsibility on the individual council to take the initiative when it comes to improving their city.

Yet growing strains on public services and budgets could negatively affect the ability of all councils to dedicate the resources required to trial technology, progress smart projects, and identify the most cost-effective path to prepare our cities for the future.

The research identified strong evidence for a lack of understanding within councils from the outset; over 80% of the 187 councils did not have an appointed lead for smart cities, and many confessed to a low awareness of the topic and what it could mean for them. Common barriers towards progression were identified, from securing funding and resourcing at a time of budget cuts, to a lack of collaboration between services and departments hindering progress.

Despite the acknowledgement that smarter solutions have the potential to save money or streamline services, many councils less involved in smart cities struggle to siphon budget away from core spending (largely health and social care) and dedicate resources to progress smart cities projects and invest in new initiatives.

Notably, those councils leading the way on smart cities were more likely to have secured external funding – and those who were more advanced along their smart journey and keen to progress further admitted to having bid for funding but lost, or needing more funding to meet their strategic aims.
<blockquote>“We aren’t hindered by funding, we are finding it from Europe, the funding available by UK government in terms of super-fast broadband, and finding our own resources from government too.”</blockquote>
This is significant as the outcome of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32810887">recent Brexit referendum</a> may make UK councils ineligible to receive EU funding.
<h2>UK projects need councils' buy-in</h2>
Without sustainable funding in place, smart city projects are failing to achieve internal buy-in, according to many councils. Research participants were asked how high a priority smart cities were on their council’s agenda. The overwhelming response was that, faced with budget pressures and shrinking resources, finding internal buy-in to progress with smart initiatives was an uphill struggle for many.

The downgrading of a smart transition as a priority for many local councils was often pinpointed to a lack of evidence to support a business case, particularly when funds are limiting and projects are competing to secure what little there may be available. Whilst some councils are enjoying the benefits of early implementation of new technology, the vast majority have struggled to obtain results and proof that would convince council leaders to divert funds to support new initiatives.
<blockquote>“A lot of the services that are provided in cities are privatised. The councils won’t benefit from the information that is derived from how people are using infrastructure, how they’re using leisure resources, how they’re using transport and so on. The council can’t actually do much with that apart from planning how the roads would work, how you know when development happens, most people who are going to benefit are the ones actually making money rather than spending it in cities and towns, and that would be businesses.”</blockquote>
The ability to apply Wi-Fi connections to street lamps in city centers was the most cited example of a smart solution already rolled out in cities. This was seen as immediately offering benefits to citizens in a cost-effective way. Situated every 30 yards on roads and streets in every city, lampposts are publicly owned, connected to an electricity supply and, by their very nature, located in urban areas. Their height makes them suited to radio communications, and smart technology is already being developed for lamp posts, from air pollution sensors and parking meters to improving security and energy efficiency with smarter street lighting.

Without meaningful financial investment and local commitment is it unlikely that many local councils will extend their smart city development beyond them.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In recent years IoT has played an important role in worker safety with wearable and embedded sensors making it possible for workers to be monitored within their surroundings to prevent injury from<a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2015/0511-01.html"> falls</a>, <a href="http://www.honeywell.com/newsroom/pressreleases/2015/11/honeywell-and-intel-demonstrate-prototype-of-wearable-iot-connected-safety-solutions-for-industrial-workers-and-first-responders">toxic gas</a>, and <a href="http://www.smartcaptech.com/">overexertion</a>. Wearable technology can prevent a range of injuries in some of the most dangerous occupations.

<a href="http://www.northstarbluescope.com/default.asp">North Star Bluescope Steel</a>, a steel producer for global building and construction industries for Australia, New Zealand and North American markets, is <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49994.wss">working with IBM</a> to develop a cognitive platform that taps into IBM Watson IoT technology for wearable safety technology to help employees stay safer in dangerous environments. By gathering and analyzing sensor data collected from sensors embedded in helmets and wrist bands, the technology, IBM Employee Wellness and Safety Solution, provides real-time alerts to employees and their managers, enabling preventive measures if physical well-being is compromised or safety procedures are not being followed.

The solution can detect hazardous combinations that individually may be overlooked. For example, a combination of skin temperature, raised heart rate, and no movement patterns for several minutes could mean a person is suffering from heat stress. Each of these signs individually would not be a cause for alert, but together they indicate a serious situation that warrants intervention.

The majorities of workplace injuries are easily preventable through personal monitoring. Injuries can be prevented, whether by ensuring that protective equipment is used correctly, or that time or location limitations for hazardous situations are monitored. Integrating and presenting contextual information to field workers from a wide variety of sensors creates more aware and well informed workers. It’s a method that is non-intrusive, hands-free, always-on, environment-aware, and offers the direct delivery of critical information to those who need it, when they need it.

Through the use of the IBM Employee Wellness and Safety Solution, we have observed an increased awareness of heat stress and exertion in our trial users, said Malcolm Edge, I.T. Director, NorthStar Bluescope Steel, adding:
<blockquote>“The solution has provided a proof of concept showcasing how data can flow from the user to the IBM Watson IoT Platform and back to a supervisor for intervention. This solution, once fully developed, will provide a solid foundation for increasing worker safety by providing real time monitoring of the environment around the worker.”</blockquote>

<h2>Steelworking and heat stress go together</h2>
In an effort to combat heat stress, Northstar is using the IBM Employee Wellness and Safety Solution to collect data from various sensors that continuously monitor the worker’s skin body temperature, heart rate, galvanic skin response and level of activity, correlated with sensor data for ambient temperature and humidity. The solution then enables Northstar to provide personalized safety guidelines to each individual employee, advising them to take a ten minute break in the shade, if temperatures rise to unsafe levels.

The same platform can be used to prevent excessive exposure to different temperatures, radiation levels, noise, or toxic gases, using sensor tags for temperature, humidity, noise, or light measurements. Gases can be detected using personal sensors enabled using Wifi or Bluetooth low energy sensors.

Connected workers are not only inherently safer, and personal monitoring can also lead to more productive workers. Monitoring workers can help implement measures that lead to less fatigue, less time spent on unnecessary tasks, and more time focused on the most critical tasks.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am one of those people that firmly believes that implanted wearables are the future of health technology. Devices like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant">cochlear implants</a> have been around since the 1980s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etonogestrel_contraceptive_implant">contraceptive implants</a> since the late 1990s and there are many other implanted medical devices that add quality to life -- or even preserve life -- from hip replacements to pacemakers.

However, outside of the medical world, implanted devices have been limited to a DIY movement called biohacking, a form of self-health monitoring which aims to take the expertise out of the hands of health professionals and into the hands of individuals. The spectrum ranges from the more benign exercise wearables to a range of DIY "body tools" and regulators, like implanted biomagnets that can used to pick up small items or an RFID chip to unlock your door or use the photocopier without a PIN code.

<h2>Cyborg Nest resets your orientation</h2>
Cyborg Nest recently launched their first commercial product, North Sense, a Bluetooth-enabled, thumbnail-sized embeddable piece of tech that attaches to your body with a couple piercings and vibrates every time it faces <a href="http://gisgeography.com/magnetic-north-vs-geographic-true-pole/">magnetic north</a>. The Cyborg Nest website couches their wearables in an unfortunately "mystical" language which obscures the practical benefits of wearables in everyday life for many people. Let's face it -- there are other more appealing wearable devices than a compass for most people.
<p class="font_8">Once fitted, the company says, "you’re given back an ancient sense of orientation, deeply rooted in our traditions, spiritual life and history. You will own a unique new ability, and this will change you. In a few months, as a cyborg, you’ll be able to experience new memories, maps and life moments, created and influenced by a new layer—your North Sense."</p>
<p class="font_8">It all seems rather excessive for a mere compass that can't even unlock a front door or connect to a map on an iPhone.</p>
<p class="font_8">The FAQ section is also quite entertaining, as the creators answer the question of how it will change people:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="font_8">"<span class="color_1">This is not a physical change – this is a mind change. Processes take time, changing from person to person. Gradually, North Sense will become part of your existence. Your brain will learn how to filter the information, exactly as it’s filtering distractions right now as you're reading this sentence."</span></p>
</blockquote>
North Sense seems tame compared to predecessors like the work of <a href="http://www.grindhousewetware.com/">Grindhouse wetware</a>, a Pittsburgh startup that created Northstar V1, an implanted wearable device, pictured below, that gives wearers "the possibility of implanting technology in the body and paves the way for more advanced and functional augmentations."

They aim to follow with Northstar Version 2, a "rechargeable device that adds gesture recognition and Bluetooth capabilities, enabling users to control electronic devices with hand movements, as well as add patterns or color variations to LED."

<img class=" wp-image-4765 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/145042778812182699_929857647097523_3743549189456536592_o-1024x683.jpg" alt="145042778812182699_929857647097523_3743549189456536592_o" width="695" height="464" />

To be fair, there are different levels of comfort and acceptance when it comes to notions of transhumanism, cyborgs and implanted wearables and this is one of the few examples of a commercial wearable that goes beyond being simply "worn."

You can pre-order North Sense now for $367, with the initial 2,000 units expected ship in September. Beyond that, you'll have to wait for the next <a href="http://biohackersummit.com/">Biohacker Summit</a> in Helsinki or liaise with <a href="https://dangerousthings.com/">Dangerous Things.</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Could robots replace us in security jobs?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A Silicon Valley company called <a href="http://knightscope.com/">Knightscope</a> has introduced a range of robots that eradicate the need for foot patrolling security guards in a range of workplaces and public spaces. These security robots are called the  K3 and K5 Autonomous Data Machines. The robots resemble a "Doctor Who" dalek, or maybe a large mobile rubbish bin depending on your point of view. This is not surprising as when the idea of a security robot comes to mind, you are inclined to think of robots like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093870/">Robocop</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVlhMGQgDkY">Atlas </a>rather than<a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/03/10/pepper-robot-helper/"> Pepper</a>.

Knightscope was originally founded in response to the tragic events at Sandy Hook and the Boston Marathon. The founders believed that with a unique combination of hardware and software, they could greatly reduce crime by as much as 50%. They explain their rationale as thus:
<blockquote>"The human attention span during monotonous, boring tasks is only 5-10 minutes. And with employee turnover rates as high as 400%, the security industry is rightfully seeking innovative solutions. Knightscope’s primary goal is to allow customers to utilize the best of Silicon Valley to put machines to work in those routine, monotonous and sometimes dangerous situations, thus freeing up humans to do the more hands-on and strategic activities. Corporate campuses, data centers, shopping malls and big-box retail stores are among the many customers already engaged today (think employee safety, corporate espionage, rogue networks and asset protection)."</blockquote>
They also state:

"This technology changes everything and is especially needed as the world continues to become more and more volatile."

Utilizing numerous sensors, lasers and a significant amount of code, the K3 and K5 can roam a geo-fenced area autonomously either randomly or based on a particular patrolling algorithm. The K5 is able to detect a vehicle backing up or tailing the machine in a parking lot setting. Further, the robots are programmed to detect suspicious and unusual behavior and can recall up to 300 number plates a minute, whilst monitoring traffic. The robots are equipped with a panic button for emergency scenarios when a real person is required.

<h2>Your shiny new mall cop</h2>
Their clients including various shopping malls and Uber who rent the robots at a cost of $7 an hour, significantly less than a security guard would command in wages. However the robots are not without controversy with a recent case that a <a href="http://fusion.net/story/324731/security-robot-runs-over-child/">robot on duty knocked over a small child</a>.  It's claimed that Harwin Cheng, 16-month-old, was walking ahead of his parents in the Stanford Shopping Centre when the security robot bumped into and knocked him down. According to the toddler's mother who witnessed the incident, the robot allegedly hit her son in the head which caused him to fall down face first. It then continued to keep moving along, running over the boy's right foot, which left it swollen along with a scrape behind his knee.

The claim is contested by Knightscope who claim their robot veered to the left to avoid running into the toddler. It said that the young boy then ran backwards and consequentially directly in the front of the machine, which then caused it to knock him over. <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160713006532/en">Knightscope quickly moved to apologize</a> to the parents and is keen to avoid a repeat occurrence.

</div></blockquote>
<div>
<h2>Should robots be used in emergencies?</h2>
The use of robots in safety situations requires some consideration before an extensive roll out, with a <a href="http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/casestudy/emergencies-should-you-trust-robot">study earlier this year by Georgia Tech Research Institute</a> revealing that people are too trustworthy of robots in an emergency. In a mock building fire, test subjects followed instructions from an “Emergency Guide Robot” even after the machine had proven itself unreliable in given previous directions – and after some participants were told that robot had broken down.

Engineer Paul Robinette said:

</div>
<blockquote>
<div>

“We expected that if the robot had proven itself untrustworthy in guiding them to the conference room, that people wouldn’t follow it during the simulated emergency. Instead, all of the volunteers followed the robot’s instructions, no matter how well it had performed previously. We absolutely didn’t expect this.”

</div></blockquote>
<div>

The researchers surmise that in the scenario they studied, the robot may have become an “authority figure” that the test subjects were more likely to trust in the time pressure of an emergency.

</div>
We've recently seen a scenario where a <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/07/12/killing-dallas-shooter-robot-right-choice-dt1/">robot was used to detonate a bomb</a> in response to a police killing, ultimately leading to the death of Micah Johnson who killed five police officers and wound seven others in Dallas. This makes it possible that robots will be deployed in future public emergency scenarios.

However it would be incorrect to surmise that robots will create unemployment. The need for skilled engineers, developers and control centre operatives to manage robots on the field and analyze the data they generate will create jobs, at least in the short term. The future will not be controlled by robots but rather, by humans with the assistance of robots.

		<title>Digital trust could be the key to ensure personal health data</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The transition into the era of electronic health records and health wearables has resulted in a plethora of electronic patient information including dates of birth, home addresses, social security records, insurance details and medical data. This data is highly desirable on the black market. But there are ways to prevent the risk for fraud.

I recently spoke to Brian Kalis, managing director of digital health at Accenture, to learn more.
<h2>Just how big is the problem?</h2>
Accenture recently released a report, <em><a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-revenue-risk-healthcare-provider-cyber-security-inaction">The revenue risk of healthcare provider cyber security inaction</a>. </em>It reveals that in 2014, nearly 1.6 million people had their medical information stolen from healthcare providers, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights. Accenture  predicts that more than 25 million people—or approximately one in 13 patients—will have their medical and/or personal information stolen from their healthcare provider’s digitized records between 2015 and 2019

Kalis explained that what most healthcare providers don’t recognize is that as a result of cyber attacks on medical information, many patients will suffer personal financial loss. In contrast to credit card identity theft, victims of medical identity theft often have no automatic right to recover their losses.

According to the<a href="https://www.ponemon.org/news-2/23"> Ponemon Institute</a>, these financial losses may take several forms. Not fully understanding their medical bills, some victims have unwittingly paid bills run up by others. Some have had to reimburse their insurers for healthcare services obtained fraudulently. Many have incurred substantial legal costs as they have sought to unravel the cyber crimes perpetuated against them. In fact, 65 percent of victims of medical identity theft pay out-of-pocket (OOP) costs at an average of $13,500 per victim.

It further shows that healthcare providers are at risk of losing $305 billion in cumulative lifetime patient revenue over the next five years due to patients switching providers because of medical identity theft. Almost half of patients said they would find a different provider if they were informed that their medical records were stolen.

<h2>What the blackhats are seeking</h2>
According to Kalis:

"Research has shown that there are multiple sources. overwhelming majority is coming from nation states and organized criminal groups, primarily because the value of medical records are greater than traditional identities on the black market, up to ten times the value of traditional credit/identity info. However there is also a high volume of employee internal responses such as the loss of laptops and usb drives, things that can be avoided through better risk management and  compliance measures".

When you think healthcare data, the data for sale includes names, birth dates, policy numbers, diagnosis codes and billing information, all of which can be utilised to create fake identification to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cybersecurity-hospitals-idUSKCN0HJ21I20140924">buy medical equipment and drugs that can be resold or to lodge fraudulent Medicare claims </a> This is compounded by delays as data breaches and medical identify theft is not always immediately identified by a patient or their provider, giving criminals years to milk such credentials. That makes medical data more valuable than credit cards, which tend to be quickly canceled by banks once fraud is detected.
<h2>Is "digital trust" an answer?</h2>
Kalis and <a href="https://www.pwc.com/sg/en/publications/assets/build_digital_trust_201312.pdf">many others</a> place great credence in the notion of "digital trust," a combination of cybersecurity, privacy and “data ethics.”  It extends beyond the notion of data security to an ethical viewpoint about "the  handling, control and providence of data. about making sure data is accurate and handled effectively. Digital ethics expands data security beyond pure safety to  the decisions and actions you take to ensure that you are using that information responsibly for the people you serve as a steward of that information."

An everyday example of this is Apple's Health Kit. After the consumer outcry from its<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-celebrity-accounts-compromised-by-very-targeted-attack-1409683803"> iCloud breach</a> in 2014, <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> came to understand the importance of trust.

According the Accenture report:
<blockquote>"Apple's efforts to be transparent in how it uses and secures customer data is testimony to the value this leading brand places on trust. Its new platforms, such as Apple Pay and HealthKit, are clear beneficiaries of this trusted-by-design approach because the strong security and ethics that are 'baked in' give customers confidence that their digital footprints are secure and private, easing the transition to and adoption of the Apple ecosystem. This underscores the role trust plays as digitally powered companies look to disrupt their own markets and enter new ones."</blockquote>
Kalis also notes that:
<blockquote>"What we’re seeing is the raising of security up to the board level, executive level response, so a lot of the ways of protecting it start with the leadership and overall aspect of making security of data a priority and then extend this philosophy to all the employees in practice. Then companies can move into more advanced ways of protecting the information internally, whether through using advanced analytics to detect both internal threats or misuses of information or external threats coming in."</blockquote>
<h2>Blockchain could also be health data's savior</h2>
Kalis also believes the blockchain can be part of the solution, as it shifts the model from centralized control to decentralized power that's ultimately controlled by the individual.  He cities the example of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/estonian-government-adopts-blockchain-to-secure-1-mln-health-records">Estonia where blockchain technology</a> is utilized to secure over a million healthcare records.

Ultimately the issue of data theft and health care fraud is complex and challenging. There's not a simple solution. It requires consumer understanding of the need to secure their health data. Healthcare companies to employ advanced data analytics and top-down cultural change from the healthcare professions to preempt data breaches and the legal system to provide appropriate detection and prosecution. As both IoT technology and criminals move quickly, the challenge will be to see if the security professionals and judicial system can keep up.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a time where the driverless automated car is becoming a modern reality, we are provided with great potential to make things previously improbable if not impossible suddenly possible.

My interest was piqued when I came across design plans for car that could be controlled by a driver with quadriplegia. At first the idea seemed mere fantasy but as I spoke to transport designer Rajshekhar Dass and learnt move about the control of technical devices through brain waves, facial gestures and infinitesimal movements the idea seemed more of conceivable.

Rajshekar Dass is a car designer from Mumbai, India currently based in Turkey. He has an impressive design history which includes fronting a winner team of the 2016 <a href="http://www.michelinchallengedesign.com/the-challenge-archives/2016-mobility-for-all/2016-showcase-of-selected-entrants/" rev="en_rl_minimal">Michelin Challenge Design</a> for the <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/30421703/Google-Community-Vehicle-Michelin-Challenge-Design" rev="en_rl_minimal">Google Community Vehicle</a> and  Winner of the  Vehicle, Mobility and Transport Design 2014-15 A'Design Award for a <a href="https://competition.adesignaward.com/design.php?ID=39442" rev="en_rl_minimal">Micro Taxi</a> among awards. He's interned for Volkswagen in Germany and worked in a range of car dealerships, so has seen car technology from a range of angles.

He detailed his rationale for a car designed specifically for people with quadraplegia, a cohort of people who until now have only featured in the automated cars of the future as mere passengers. Such a design is the first of its kind:
<blockquote>"<a href="https://www.behance.net/rajshekhardass" rev="en_rl_minimal">Audric Design</a> basically was designed with a particular person in mind, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Schmidt" rev="en_rl_minimal">Sam Schmidt</a>, former Indy Racing League driver. He was made paraplegic due to a racing car accident in 2000.  He wanted to get back on the track but came back as an owner rather than driver. Everyone loves driving so my interest was how can we use today’s technology to solve these problems for an audience that are generally overlooked? How can today’s tech be used to enable the same driving experience that he enjoyed previously?"</blockquote>
It's always interesting to learn how a designer approaches the design experience, Dass revealed:
<blockquote>"the first point of research is the capabilities of the human body when functionality has been impaired. In paraplegia the brain signals do not reach the human organs  bellow the neck, so the brain signals are basically lost. I thought, what if you could use today's technology to enable the signals to be transferred to the computers onboard of a car instead, so you can give a rebirth to the whole driving experience?"</blockquote>
Dass explained that emerging technology like movement through brain wave signals,  gesture and facial recognition and sensor technology s along with  augmented reality made his design more than a well intentioned concept.

There's precedence here. For example, in 2010 <a href="http://emotiv.com/" rev="en_rl_minimal"> Emotiv</a> released the <a href="http://emotiv.com/epoc/" rev="en_rl_minimal">Emotiv Epoch+</a>, a commercial wearable device designed to enable users to play computer games on a screen through functioning as a brain-computer interface device (Admittedly the design was not without it's challenges as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010/01/27/review-emotiv-epoc-tough-thoughts-on-the-new-mind-reading-cont/" rev="en_rl_minimal">this review </a>attests).

Then in 2014, Ian Burkhart became the first paralyzed person to use neural bypass technology <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/paralyzed-patient-regains-hand-movement-using-own-brain-signals/" rev="en_rl_minimal">to pick up and hold a spoon</a> using his own brainpower, with his abilities increasing overtime.
<div><img class="size-large wp-image-4870 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/audric_vehicle_5-1024x386.jpg" alt="audric_vehicle_5" width="1024" height="386" /></div>
<div></div>
<h2>How could it work?</h2>
Dass stresses that the car would be completely autonomous in the first instance. But over time, the driver's gestures and motions would be recorded by the car; for example, as the car is taking a right turn, the driver might be tilting his head. In this way, the car is learning from the driver instead of the driver learning from the car.

Dass explains further:
<blockquote>
<div>"There would be a series of levels which would be detected by the AI in the car, that slowly give the control to the driver. e.g. starting with audio and air-conditioning controls first. The next level could be controlling a little bit of the motion and <em>slowly</em> you’d graduate levels as you would in a game with the help of gesture recognition, eye movements and brain mapping. Once the car is confident as to the skill of the driver the complete controls would be available to the driver. but at the same time the car would still have the control over all the systems, as a built-in safety feature.</div></blockquote>
<div>

I'm aware that many people with paralysis experience involuntary movement such as spasms and jerking. I wondered if a car could be smart enough to distinguish these movements from voluntary actions.

Dass agreed:
<blockquote>
<div></div>
It's a good point. The car is completely autonomous and the AI is constantly monitoring the driver's motions to learn his/her actions, and since the AI is specially developed for paralyzed drivers it can recognize such involuntary movements. Since the AI is also scanning the brain and can understand that the motion has no connection with the brain signals it can be tagged as involuntary action and not require a reaction".</blockquote>
As well as its driving capabilities, the car would also be designed specifically with the needs of the driver in mind with a rear entry door suited to a wheelchair which would be specially designed to become the driving seat in the vehicle. Dass explained that the project has only been recently published online and he is keen to explore his ideas further with people with disabilities and associated organizations to enable further development.

In an era where ideas as seemingly bizarre as Google's patent for“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/18/google-patents-sticky-layer-self-driving-car-accidents" rev="en_rl_minimal">sticky” technology to protect pedestrians</a> if they get struck by Google's self-driving cars, a mind powered car doesn't seem all that strange at all.

Dass is working on a range of diverse projects currently and judging by the ingenuity inherent in his design <a href="https://www.behance.net/rajshekhardass" rev="en_rl_minimal">portfolio</a>, this is simply an example of things to come.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The world of agricultural technology, or agtech, is rapidly evolving.

It's <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/04/04/iot-makes-smart-wine-agriculture-if4/">automating laborious tasks</a> and<a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/06/07/can-arables-iot-device-end-world-hunger-vl1/"> providing farmers and growers with greater knowledge and insight</a> into their crops than ever before. As technology evolves so does the needs of the farmer and the growing environment. Around 20% of the world's food production is grown within cities rather rural areas and inherent in this is the<a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/growth-in-the-hydroponics-food-industry-set-to-outpace-global-markets-by-80-241264701.html"> multi-billion dollar industry of indoor growing and hydroponics</a>.

The industry includes $5 billion in urban farming in the US and $5.7 billion for legal cannabis production.

Agtech company <a href="http://www.motorleaf.com/">motorleaf</a> have released the world's first wireless monitoring, motion detection and automated growing system for hobby and industrial growers. I spoke to CEO and co-founder Ally Monk to learn more.

According to Monk, the idea originated when as a keen indoor hobby gardener, motorleaf's co-founder and CTO Ramen Dutta wanted to go on holidays and needed a system to take care of his plants in his absence:
<blockquote>
<div class="_4nq6">"Ramen was going on vacation, but he had the problem of what would happen to his plants in his absence. He looked at the market and assumed there would be something like a smart home system akin to google Nest but there was nothing.  So he started making a HUB that could monitor what was going on and automate a range of appliances such as the water chiller and water level, air temperature, webcam, heating, and cooling. He soon realized that other indoor farmers were interested. <div id="TYQqUJbBZXNg6Y9NT3" style="width: 230px"><a href="http://www.viagragenericoes24.com/viagra-para-las-marcas/">viagra para las marcas</a></div> "</div></blockquote>
<h2>How motorleaf works</h2>
[caption id="attachment_5016" align="aligncenter" width="458"]<img class="wp-image-5016 size-full" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-07-25-at-11.35.37.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-25 at 11.35.37" width="458" height="375" /> The Heart[/caption]

Motorleaf has created a system that can automate and monitor an indoor growth area with up to 5 acre coverage. Their hardware, described by some as <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/motorleaf#/entity">"Nest meets Lego for agriculture</a>" is designed to be plug-and-play, and the grower decides which part of their plant operation they control/monitor and automate. It consists of four modular units:
<ul>
 	<li><em>The Heart</em> collects Air Temp, Humidity, &amp; Light Level data. Users can connect any lighting hardware, and feeder pump- and start automating their operation in seconds.</li>
 	<li><em>The Power Leaf</em> connects wirelessly to the Heart which tells them when to turn on and off, based upon pre-set times or sensor readings from the Heart and Droplet.</li>
 	<li> <em>The Droplet</em> monitors everything that’s connected to a grower's water reservoir. Every 4 seconds The Droplet wirelessly sends data to The Heart, information on water level, temperature, PH level, and nutrient levels.</li>
 	<li><em>The Driplet </em>allows growers to automate the delivery of PH and Nutrients, again based upon timer setting or actual live grow conditions.</li>
</ul>
<img class="size-full wp-image-5015 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-07-25-at-11.39.24.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-25 at 11.39.24" width="750" height="461" />

The system is agnostic, retails for about $1,500 and contains free software which facilitates custom settings, so the motorleaf hardware will automate the grower's equipment and adjust to their crop's needs. It's available online and offline as many growers do not have WiFi in their crop space.  It also alerts the grower to any problems that need attending to.

More importantly, it also involves intuitive efforts in predicting and anticipating the needs of the plants. Monk says:
<div>
<blockquote>
<div>"We’ve never been able to speak to plants but now through technology we can listen to them through their data, we can then understand what they need and feedback instructions to the equipment that's looking after them so we can best serve their crops.</div></blockquote>
</div>
He also notes the many people's depiction of the farmer outdoor engaged in manual labour as not entirely actually noting "The farmer of the future looks after his farm through his mobile phone and tablet." He adds that indoor growers in particular have needs which can be more complex than traditional farming:
<blockquote>
<div>"When you start growing indoors you have to mimic nature, they have worry bout all the things they have to control indoors such as PH; nutrients, humidity, light, air temperature.  How are they controlling it? Switches, controllers, some software  and in many cases people are still using pen and paper. Urban farming is on the rise but the technology that looks after this is really lagging behind."</div></blockquote>
Motorleaf is well-timed to respond to an emerging market. They receive receives 40,000 data points per customer per week and therefore can start predicting a crop’s needs, solving potential problems before they exist. Also, the start-up plans to use its network of data and growers to connect users to each other – on an opt-in basis – to share data, plant recipes and knowledge.

With the growth in indoor agriculture, hobby farmers and small to medium enterprises will soon benefit from effective IoT technology that enables smart crops and smart farming.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems that every day a new IoT device or means to connect existing devices is revealed. With so much energy in being devoted to tell us how, when, where, what we can connect to each other, the “why” may be getting a little blurry. So we want to take a step back every now and<a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/08/31/calm-cruel-and-connected-augusts-best-and-worst-of-iot-dl1/"> take a calm, cruel and critical look</a> at the connected devices that actually go out and buy, right now.

Here’s what caught our eye, for all the right – or wrong – reasons:
<h2>PIN Genie Smart Lock</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-7489 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/c2918a25b5b53d112a9464ceccd417b4_original.jpg" alt="c2918a25b5b53d112a9464ceccd417b4_original" width="680" height="453" />

Home security is a big concern to all, especially those who offer their properties for Airbnb. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/106385760/pin-genie-smart-lock?search=commandpartners">PIN Genie Smart Lock</a> is the first peep-proof and hidden camera-proof PIN door lock. Equipped with a patent-pending touchscreen pad, it shortens your ten-digit passcode into just four buttons for simple usability. With each use, PIN Genie Smart Lock reshuffles the numbers. No one will be able to guess your unique PIN, even if they’re watching. Go ahead, dare your friends! They won’t be able to guess your PIN code.

My initial concern was that it would be a struggle when you are unable to see clearly to type the PIN number after far too many cocktails  -- particularly as after three failed attempts the PIN pad will be disabled for one hour. Fortunately, you can still use a corresponding app or physical key alternatively to open the door, covering all bases. They're now crowdfunding on<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/106385760/pin-genie-smart-lock?search=commandpartners"> Kickstarter</a> and you can preorder your very own.

<em>Verdict: Hit</em>
<h2>Sony glass sound speaker</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-6072 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/glass_speaker_freshersmag_07.jpg" alt="glass_speaker_freshersmag_07" width="850" height="516" />

&nbsp;

Envisage a rather delicate looking wireless lamp with a speaker. Bundle it with a suite of exclusive products by Sony called <a href="http://www.sony.com/electronics/life-space-ux">Life Space UX</a>. Add a marketing campaign that includes a troupe of hipsters carrying the lamp through a forest at night and using it for a spot of <a href="http://www.glamping.com/what-is-glamping/">glamping</a>.

Add a price tag of $799. Yes, it's essentially $800 for a lantern/speaker combo, made of easily breakable components like glass, just right for when you trip over a tree root. Apparently the sound quality is excellent. But you could buy a flashlight for $20 and stay in a hotel instead.

<em>Verdict: Miss</em>
<h2>Alchema</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7496" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/7e114aec1e9cdc356823d1acf8d1119e_original-1024x576.jpg" alt="7e114aec1e9cdc356823d1acf8d1119e_original" width="1024" height="576" />

DIY homebrewing and fermenting is a hobby enjoyed by many all around the world. Coming from a home where you could be awakened by homemade ginger beer bottles exploding in the laundry, there's a number of very tangible benefits to the <a href="http://www.alchema.com/product">Alchema </a>system.

It comes with recipes on a corresponding app which also includes key facts about your current batch, including fermentation temperature, pressure, and alcohol content. The latter is particularly important as it's extremely difficult to measure the alcohol content of homemade booze with any definite accuracy, meaning a particularly potent beverage could put you down for hours.

There's even a built-in sanitization tool meaning you no longer need chemicals to sterilize the equipment. There are a few negatives. The device is a relatively small size, considering homemade enthusiasts typically like to make generous quantities to give away to neighbors and friends. It's unclear if you can bottle the finished product after fermenting and how long it would keep outside of device. It also comes at a rather high price of $429. That said, it's one of the most interesting products in the home drinks market and will give devices like the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/brewie-world-s-first-fully-automated-home-brewery-beer-brewery#/">Brewie</a> and <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/minibrew-the-easiest-smartest-brewing-machine#/">MiniBrew </a>some competition. If you'd like your own, it's now crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/alchema-turn-fruit-into-personalized-craft-cider-food-diy#/">Kickstarter</a>.

<em>Verdict: Hit</em>
<h2>Bedjet</h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-7499 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-17.39.45-1024x590.jpg" alt="screen-shot-2016-09-19-at-17-39-45" width="1024" height="590" />

The <a href="https://bedjet.com/products/bedjet-v2-dual-zone-climate-comfort-system-with-biorhythm-sleep-technology">BedJet</a> is based on the hardly new notion of enabling a bed to be an appropriate temperature to suit the needs of both bedfellows. This is not achieved through different sleepwear or bed blankets but instead a BedJet AirComforter sheet that contains two separate hollow cavities in which BedJet Air Nozzles fill, gently distributing the warming or cooling air to a specific half of the bed.

The temperature/air flow can be modified via a corresponding<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bedjet.remote"> app</a>. But to be exact, if you want to temperature control <em>both</em> sides of the bed  -- presumably the point -- you need to buy the Dual Zone bundle for independent cooling and warming to each half of the bed with two BedJet machines -double the price at $929. I'm sure I'm not the only one reminded of those air conditioners that funnel air out the window via a plastic pipe. It's hard to believe people would actually buy this, but apparently they do!

<h2>Lowiee smart cigarette case</h2>
<img class=" wp-image-7502 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/background-en-1024x435.jpg" alt="background-en" width="970" height="411" />

Quitting smoking can a difficult and disheartening experience for many. French company <a href="http://www.lowiee.com/">Lowiee</a> have come up with a novel way to support people in the process through a connected cigarette case. Users can set the number of cigarettes they want to smoke in a day along with a time interval between the dispensing of each cigarette. This brings a level of awareness into one's smoking habits and behavior. The case is fingerprint locked so no one else can gain entry.

An app enables you to share your progress with others trying to quit smoking, including the amount of money you have saved, so you can compare your achievements and challenge each other. It's only available as a pre-order right now, but it adds an additional level of engagement that current smoking cessation apps lack.

<em>Verdict: Hit</em>
<h2>Little Rooster alarm clock</h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-7505 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/31Jk1WeftYL._SX425_.jpg" alt="31jk1weftyl-_sx425_" width="425" height="389" />

The latest connected pleasure product to hit the internet is designed to make your mornings a happy experience. It's basically a wearable sex toy that claims to gradually awaken the wearer over 5 minutes with an orgasm.

With the assertion <em>"</em>Set the alarm and slip it in your panties. Because of its shape you won't notice it,<em>"</em> the makers of the<a href="http://www.littleroosterstore.com/"> Little Rooster </a>connected sex toy/alarm clock are obviously heavier sleepers than the rest of us. It's a product that leaves me with more questions than answers. How could you not notice a big hunk of plastic in your nether regions? What happens when you roll over in bed? Can you put it on snooze? What if it got hacked via the app? How will they get the app in the iTunes store? Read the customer comments for a laugh, as users confess to wearing it outside of the bedroom. My favorite:
<blockquote>"I used to fall asleep and miss my stop. I don't miss it now! Plus, my colleagues have noticed a change, but I haven't told them why."</blockquote>
The device has 27 ultra-quiet levels of intensity, plus three more super-loud ones for the deep sleepers. Will it get you out of bed on time? Well, it might not if it works as well as the customers claim. It retails at around $57. Why do so many connected sex toys come from the UK?

<em>Verdict: Hey you decide, to each their own. </em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Petnet&#039;s failure is a warning to IoT developers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[News sites  and social media has been abuzz the last few days with the situation that the<a href="http://www.petnet.io/"> Petnet</a> automated pet feeder was experiencing <a href="https://twitter.com/petnetiosupport/status/758149586829529088">system failure</a> raising significant questions about the reliability of connected devices.

The situation unfolded on Wednesday when angry PetNet owners posted a email from Petnet to Twitter which advised them:
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">"You may experience a loss of scheduled feeds and failed remote feedings. Please ensure that your pets have been fed manually until we have resolved this issue".</p>
</blockquote>
<img class="size-large wp-image-5184 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/CoWz1YJUEAA2KuN-1024x429.jpg" alt="CoWz1YJUEAA2KuN" width="1024" height="429" />

The <a href="http://www.petnet.io/">Petnet </a>is a smart pet feeder with features including "“intelligent sensor technology, learning algorithms, and processing power that assesses the dietary requirements of a pet" and a custom feeding schedule via a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/petnet-mobile/id962239016?mt=8">corresponding app</a> with alerts to pet owners when their pet has been fed and reminders when food supplies are running low.  It's usage scenarios may include when an owner is late home, wanting to avoid an early morning or of course on holidays. Thus, it's understandable that pet owners have met the situation with outrage.

According to PetNet’s CEO, Carlos Herrera, the third-party server service, that the company rents from Google, had been down for around 10 hours and did not have redundancy backups, further claiming that PetNet was preparing to roll out a workaround to the problem, as explained to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/27/petnet-auto-feeder-glitch-google">The Guardian</a>. Herra further claimed that about 10% of PetNet users were affected, and that the feeders can operate on previously set schedules without this particular third-party service, though users lose the ability to feed remotely or change the feeding schedule.
<h2>The rise of the connected pet</h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-5187 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/20140715171220-_HC_0767w-1024x683.jpg" alt="20140715171220-_HC_0767w" width="1024" height="683" />

<a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/03/03/pet-tech-love/">Connected pets</a> are nothing new as the era of wearables and connected technology mean pet owners are able to gain greater insight into the needs and health of their furriest family members. Automated pet feeders of old are becoming replaced by digitised versions that claim to (depending on brand) not only supply feed and water on a regular basis but also check the quantity of food and water consumed;  notify you when pet <a href="http://getnibbles.com/">food is running low</a>; provide camera shots and video footage of your pets; enable you to talk to your pet via your phone or laptop and distinguish your cats from each other through <a href="http://catfi.com/pro.html">facial recognition technology</a>. You can even get specific <a href="https://www.sureflap.com/en-us/pet-feeder/microchip-pet-feeder">RFID tagged devices</a> to stop your pets from stealing each others food. At any time there's an abundance of pet products on the market including at the time of writing, over 150 connected devices on Kickstarter seeking funds. But until this week the notion of what happens when the technology fails, placing our beloved pets potentially at risk has been notably absent.
<h2>Lessons from the PetNet's failure</h2>
It's been a while since I heard the term <em>'internet of stupid'</em> but a number of people on twitter have assigned it to the IoT sector in light of this situation. Inherent with connected hardware design are possible failure scenarios like problems with internet connectivity, wifi, a residential blackout or the system needing a reboot/restart. These all should have been anticipated. Surely the possibility of system failure or even a failure in internet connectivity should have been anticipated in the design phase with worst case scenario plan available such as a back up feeding schedule connected to the local unit in case of such situations?

It's noteworthy that whilst PetNet has been able to <a href="https://twitter.com/petnetiosupport">resolve their server problem</a> in a reasonable time frame, the stress of the situation on holidaying pet owners cannot be underestimated. It really is a great opportunity for opponents of IoT to post pictures of vulnerable kittens and puppies waiting at home, alone for their dinner. A few twitter and facebook updates and an email does not do much to reassure people. However it is commendable that the company is contacting consumers directly to ensure their system is up and working.

The biggest lesson for consumers, is there need to read the fine print associated with any connected devices they purchase, especially where at risk scenarios may result. There are some interesting limitations of service that effectively ensure that PetNet is not held responsible for any service failures:

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5189" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-07-29-at-14.20.36-1024x452.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-29 at 14.20.36" width="1024" height="452" />

The situation also raises the bigger issues about the viability of automated pet feeders as devices in themselves.  Few accommodate multi-pet families where different diets for different breeds or species are required, making the product impractical for many pet owners. Then there's the real life realities of pet ownership. Food is a useful training tool for pet owners, especially for cats that typically employ disdain to any training attempts. Animals need regular human contact, affection and play and in the case of dogs, regular exercise. Are we going a step too far placing the nutritional needs of our animals at the mercy of the failure of connected devices?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The 2016 Olympic Games in Rio bring not only teams of highly trained athletes but also bags full of wearable technology which aims to monitor the health and physicality of athletics as they prepare for peak performance.

In these latest Games, we see sports psychology usurped by neuroscience that is designed to maximize the power of the mind. One company working hard in this space is <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/">Halo Neuroscience</a>.

I've had the pleasure to interview the CEO <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/04/27/halo-neuro-change-brain-efficiency-vw1/">previously</a> after their pre-sales sold out within their first week of availability. So I was keen to speak to Olympic athletes and coaches that are using Halo Sport in preparation for the 2016 Olympics.
<h2>Meet the Halo Sport</h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-5528 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/halo-sport-1024x576-1024x576.jpg" alt="halo-sport-1024x576" width="1024" height="576" />

Halo Neuroscience has created a a headset called Halo Sport. It resembles a pair of headphones and uses what it call <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/">neuro-priming</a> – another term for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation">transcranial direct current stimulation</a>. This involves the use of electrical pulses to encourage the brain to form new pathways to increase performance. When paired with rigorous athletic training, athletes see improved strength, explosiveness, and skill. The United States Olympic Ski and Snowboard Association saw a 1.7X increase in performance when training with Halo Sport.

The athletes using the device in preparation for the Rio Olympics include <a href="http://www.teamusa.org/usa-track-and-field/athletes/Michael-Tinsley">Michael Tinsley</a>, a 400m hurdler who won silver at the 2012 Olympics in London; <a href="http://www.teamusa.org/usa-track-and-field/athletes/Mike-Rodgers">Mike Rodgers</a>, who runs 100m sprints and will compete for gold on the relay team; <a href="https://www.iaaf.org/athletes/trinidad-and-tobago/mikel-thomas-237307">Mikel Thomas</a>, a hurdler from Trinidad &amp; Tobago who is competing in his third Olympics; <a href="https://www.iaaf.org/athletes/sierra-leone/hafsatu-kamara-281637">Hafsatu Kamara</a>, a female sprinter from Sierra Leone who is competing in her first Olympics and <a href="http://www.teamusa.org/usa-modern-pentathlon/athletes/Samantha-Achterberg">Samantha Achterberg</a>, a modern pentathlete from the United States who won gold at the 2012 U.S. Nationals.

[caption id="attachment_5529" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="size-full wp-image-5529" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/28522139940_e90eb2af26_z.jpg" alt="MIke Rodgers" width="640" height="427" /> Mike Rodgers[/caption]

Rodgers discussed his experience using this tech:
<blockquote>“As an Olympian, I spend countless hours working out—both in the gym and on the track. Before Halo, I hadn’t seen a comprehensive solution to prepare the brain these for high-performance athletic activities. With Halo, I’m excited to get closer to my potential and reach an even higher level of athletic excellence.” – Mike Rodgers, USA, 400m sprint</blockquote>
Kamara claims a definite increase in strength:
<blockquote>“I’ve been an athlete long enough to know when I have more strength and power, and I can definitely say that Halo Sport has helped me improve in those areas. During resistance training for example, I usually do weighted hip thrusts at 100 kg — after using Halo, I can now train at 120 kg and I feel like my training is pushing me in top form.” – Hafsatu Kamara, Sierra Leone, 100 &amp; 200m sprint</blockquote>
I was wondering about what their coaches' perspectives would be. Darryl Woodson, USA Track &amp; Field Coach noted:
<blockquote>“Before I was introduced to Halo Sport, I was always fascinated about how to improve the brain’s role in athletic performance. Every athlete knows the importance of training the mind, whether through visualization, watching film, or maintaining focus, but I was interested in how to improve the communication between the brain and muscles. Now that I’ve used Halo Sport with my athletes, I’m amazed that the brain has such a huge impact on performance. Integrating Halo Neurotechnology into my workouts transforms our training.”</blockquote>
It's clear that wearables are a key tool in maximizing physical potential in physical endeavors. It's foreseeable that in the future wearables will be permitted as acceptable sportswear whilst competing. How this is managed and policed with be complicated, particularly in individual sports.

But for these games, Halo Sport is not the only wearable inhabiting this space, whoever partners with a medal winner has the potential to bring their wearable device to the masses.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Music is extremely powerful. We all accept that it can affect our emotions and the way we feel, but science is showing that it has more direct effects on the brain as well, particularly when it is paired with wearables devices.

<a href="https://www.brain.fm/app#!/">Brain.fm</a> is a freemium auditory program designed to help people either focus, relax or sleep using AI-generated music. It's users include students, insomniacs and athletes. Heavily steeped in scientific research, its creators have a history in making niche audio brainwave software for psychologists and researchers and their work includes patents on auditory brainwave stimulation and memory.

<em><strong>See also:</strong><a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/04/17/ibm-iot-tour-de-france-wearables-vl1/"> IoT disrupts the Tour de France</a></em>

I spoke to Brain.fm co-founder Adam Hewett, client and Olympic athlete Robby Smith, and Junaid Kalmadi, who looks after business development for Brain.fm. Smith is using Brain.fm as part of his preparations for the 2016 Rio Olympics.
<h2>How does Brain.fm work?</h2>
Hewett explained their work is based on a number of audio principles that are combined using AI:
<blockquote> "First, if you're listening via earbuds or headphones, you'll notice right off the bat that the sounds seem as if they are moving around your head. The sounds will start out on the side but will move to where they seem as if they are coming from the front, about a book's length or screen's length away. This helps focus you on the task in front of you. In the case of relaxation or sleep, the sounds will seems as if they are swirling all about you, and this can simulate the way it feels to sway in a hammock or rock in a cradle, because the brain picks up balancing cues from the ears. It's the first thing you'll notice when you use Brain.fm.

Next, we employ two little known auditory principles called Dynamic Attending Theory and 'entrainment,' where rhythms appear to have a more direct effect on the brain. You'll notice that the rhythm is very consistent and that you quickly fall into a mental rhythm yourself - it's easy to get into the "zone" using Brain.fm, and lose track of time as you focus on your work. But it's not just the rhythms that you hear that matter: there are also very rapid, very precise rhythms embedded into the sound. You probably won't even notice them, but if you try you may hear tiny flutters in the sound here and there. These modulations produce a direct effect on the brain that we can examine and confirm using EEG and MRI tests.

The AI is necessary because we wanted the music to be good! And good music is extremely complex to compose. In order to make these principles work for us, we had to find a way to synchronize every single note and beat to the goal of the session, with millisecond precision. It started out as an algorithm, but it rapidly became apparent that we needed something smart - something that could actually compose the music."</blockquote>

<h2>Even athletes need to learn to focus and relax</h2>
<a href="http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Wrestling/Athlete-Bios/SM/Robby-Smith">Robby Smith</a>, the U.S. Olympic wrestling team captain, is a Brain.Fm client. He explained how it's been helpful in relaxation and sleep inducement:
<blockquote>"I listen to Focus and Relaxation when I'm lifting weights - those sessions help me focus and have the right intensity I need at that moment in time. As an athlete, the closer you get to a tournament the mind begins to work non-stop and it's hard to shut it down. So in bed trying to fall asleep, my mind thinks about every single scenario and I'm constantly dreaming about wrestling with little restful sleep. Ever since I started using the sleep option in brain.fm, I've been completely off melatonin and sleep aids. It's been my go-to tool to fall asleep since I began few months ago.

For meditation, I combine brain.fm with breath work or simply relax when I have a short 20 to 30 minute window. I prioritize letting my body relax every day, so I usually lay on my back, focus on my breathing and listen to brain.fm's relax or meditation sessions2</blockquote>
He even has a particular routine in preparation for the Olympics:
<blockquote>"I listen to the focus sessions before practice to help me get 'in the zone,' and then after practice, I can come to my room and use the Relaxation sessions to focus on my breath and calm myself down, because I don't need to be at that high intensity level all the time. I also use the sleep sessions to help myself fall asleep at night, which is very important for recovery from practice each day."</blockquote>
<img class="size-full wp-image-5521 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/BrainFM-Focus-VisualPatternRecognition2.jpg" alt="BrainFM-Focus-VisualPatternRecognition2" width="634" height="428" />

While Brain.fm's program is validated by<a href="https://www.transparentcorp.com/blog/brainwave-entrainment-beginners-guide/"> science</a>, I was curious to learn how about how the team was able to make their idea financially viable. We often hear that marketing software in a crowded market place. Kalmadi explained:
<blockquote>"<span style="line-height: 1.5;">In November 2015, we did a soft launch with Brain.fm on three early adopter communities: AppSumo, Product Hunt and Hacker News. With AppSumo, we sold $300k of Brain.fm product in a week and acquired over 11,300 customers. With Product Hunt, we hit the top 50 most up-voted product of over 20,000 products on the internet. With Hacker News, we were were up-voted #1 for 24 hours. These three launch moments generated enough word-of-mouth buzz enabling us to grow to $45k in monthly revenue."</span></blockquote>
According to Kalmadi, the biggest challenge for Brain.fm has been making the tangible benefits of their product apparent in as shorter period of time as possible:
<blockquote>"In the earlier versions of Brain.fm it required weeks or even months of consistent listening in order to notice the differences. After 15 months of tinkering, we've now advanced the core technology to the point where users experience the benefits of deeper focus, reduced stress and restful sleep in the first 10-15 minutes of listening."</blockquote>
<h2>Does it work for us mere mortals?</h2>
You can try Brain.fm for free a number of times before payment is required. Most writers are terrible procrastinators and I've only tried it once but was rudely interrupted by my cat walking across the trackpad of my laptop thus stopping the music. I'll definitely be giving it another go...when my cat's asleep.

Brain.fm will be launched in app form in the near future and it's seems highly applicable with a range of connected devices to aid and monitor sleep and manage focus. The developers are currently working with working with neuroscientists at Wesleyan University to release a landmark study on Brain.fm's results on the brain which will hopefully lead to future collaborations and opportunities.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's been another wild year in swimming at the 2016 Rio Olympics. The last events wrap up today, but it's been hard to miss the appearance of more technology poolside this year, even if all you noticed were the headphones helping Michael Phelps maintain his death-stare:

&nbsp;

But getting into the zone while on deck isn't that new. Getting closer to a world record is the greater goal of all this new technology. Here's what you might have seen in swimmer's bags this year:
<h2>The Misfit Shine</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-5641 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/misfitshine.jpg" alt="misfitshine" width="635" height="448" />

In June, wearables company <a href="https://misfit.com/">Misfit</a> and well know sports swimming brand<a href="http://www.speedo.com/"> Speedo</a> announced the launch of their second Speedo-branded activity, swim, and sleep tracker, <a href="https://misfit.com/products/shine2-swimmer-edition">Misfit Shine 2 Swimmers Edition</a>. Misfit and Speedo’s proprietary lap counting algorithms track a swimmer’s lap count with industry-leading accuracy and work for all stroke types.

New features with Speedo Shine include:
<ul>
 	<li> A vibration motor and multicolor lights, enabling multi-faceted user feedback—see progress and tell time in a halo of rainbow-colored lights, or get motivated with Misfit Move activity</li>
 	<li>A countdown swim timer—users pick a time to swim and Speedo Shine 2 provides a gentle vibe alert when a workout is complete</li>
 	<li>Text and call notifications and a silent vibe alarm</li>
 	<li>Misfit Link compatibility, turning Speedo Shine 2 into a music remote, selfie trigger, presentation clicker, or button to enable a variety of smart home devices and web services</li>
</ul>
<h2>VTT wearable sensors</h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-5642 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/vtt_uimari-1024x575.jpg" alt="vtt_uimari" width="1024" height="575" />

In cooperation with Finland's national  swimming team and archery association, <a href="http://www.vtt.fi/medialle/uutiset/suomalaisurheilijat-hakevat-%C3%A4lyteknologiasta-vauhtia-olympialaisiin-%E2%80%93-usa-n-olympiakomitea-etsii-kumppaneita-suomesta">VTT Technical Research Centre</a> of Finland has developed wearable technology for improving sports performance. Wearable sensors can be attached to, say, a swimmer's hand paddles or an archer's equipment. From there, data is wirelessly transferred to the coach's smartphone or tablet<strong>.  </strong>

The sensors embedded in the paddles provide surprisingly precise and varied data on the wearer's swimming technique. This covers stroke length and changes in it during swimming, the relationship between the outward stroke and recovery, the structure of the stroke and the average pull, the hand position and the pressure exerted by the stroke in different directions. According to Simo Karvinen, the Finnish Junior Olympic Team coach:
<blockquote>"Swimming is an unusual sport because it is not easy for the athlete to check his or her own performance in the water. In addition, very few means are available of measuring development in the swimmer's technique, in terms such as the efficiency of hand strokes. VTT's technology provides a means of directly observing the power of each hand stroke and its trajectory through the water, without disrupting performance."</blockquote>
<h2>Using sound data to boost performance</h2>
Researchers at Bielefeld University have developed a system that professional swimmers can use to optimize their swimming technique. It enables swimmers to hear, in real time, how the pressure of the water flows created by the swimmer changes with their movements. This gives the swimmer an advantage over their competitors because they can refine the execution of their technique. This <a href="https://www.cit-ec.de/en/content/news/boosting-swimming-performance-sound-data">“Swimming Sonification”</a> system was developed at the Cluster of Excellence Cognitive Interaction Technology (CITEC) of Bielefeld University.

Dr. Thomas Hermann of CITEC is working on converting data into sounds that can be used to benefit the listener. This is called sonification, a process in which measured data values are systematically turned into audible sounds and noises. “In this project, we are using the pressure from water flows as the data source,” says Hermann. “We convert into sound how the pressure of water flows changes while swimming – in real time. We play the sounds to the swimmer over headphones so that they can then adjust their movements based on what they hear,” explains Hermann.

This system includes two gloves worn during practice, featuring thin tube ends that serve as pressure sensors and are fixed between the fingers. The tubes are linked to a measuring device that transmits data about water flow pressure to a laptop. Custom-made software then sonifies the data; it turns the information into sound. The sounds are transmitted to the swimmer in real time over headphones. When the swimmer modifies a movement, he hears live how this also changes the sound.

In a practical workshop held in September 2015, professional swimmers tested the system out and confirmed that it indeed helped them to optimize their swimming technique. Of the ten swimmers who participated, three of them qualified for international competitions, and one of the female swimmers is competing this year at the Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The researchers want to continue developing their current prototype. “We are planning to develop a wearable system that can be used independently by the user, without the help of others,” says Thomas Hermann. In addition to this, the new sonification method is planned to be incorporated into long-term training programs in cooperation with swim clubs.
<h2>Samsung blind cap</h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-5644 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/BlindCapSamsung3-1024x571.png" alt="BlindCapSamsung3" width="1024" height="571" />

Samsung's latest innovation is  a special swimming cap that vibrates to alert the swimmers precisely when to do their flip turn at the end of the pool. The <a href="http://www.blindcap.com/en/">Blind Cap</a> eliminates the need for a coach or guide to physically tap the swimmer with a pole to indicate the lane coming to an end -- the method used since swimming for the blind was established as an official Paralympic sport in 1960.

The Blind Cap is equipped with a vibrating sensor and Bluetooth technology. It synchronizes with the Samsung Gear S2 smartwatch and any Android smartphone to work in conjunction with an app. This allows the swimmer's coach to send a warning signal from their smartphone or smartwatch, which is converted into a vibration within the cap of the blind swimmer, prompting the swimmer to turn without additional help.
<h2>What about swimming googles?</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-5645 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/1395377884375735334.jpg" alt="1395377884375735334" width="679" height="383" />

Evidence suggests that connected googles are indeed on the way but seem to be taking longer in manufacturing than anticipated. <a href="https://www.oncoursegoggles.com/">OnCourse Googles</a> is created googles designed for open water swimming (ok, so technically these are more for the World Aquatic Games than the Olympics) to help keep the wearer swimming in a straight line using a pair of subtle LEDs. The goggles analyze the direction the user is swimming and if they veer off course. LEDs notify them of which direction they need to swim in order to remain on course as well as the severity of deviation.

These were predicted to be launched in the summer of 2016 but remain absent. Lebanon-based startup <a href="http://www.instabeat.me/">Instabeat</a> has also created smart googles that specifically measure a swimmer's heartbeat. However they've been subject to significant delays of over two years and are pledging to go to retail in Q1 2017.

In a sport where the difference between winning and losing is a hundredth of a second, there are no doubt boxes of technological innovations that are kept under wraps by the Olympic teams.

We'll probably only become aware of these if medalists and their media machine sponsors, decide to share the word.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Shop and Ride beacon and app system, powered by <span class="s2"><a href="https://www.xerox.com/">Xerox</a>, is promising to</span> deliver personalized, hyperlocal, mobile offers to transit riders based on their preferences and travel patterns. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Beacon technology placed in local bus shelters and at merchant sites communicates with the app so users are notified of existing offers in the area or at a particular store. With a single touch, riders can save a coupon to redeem it immediately or at a later time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em><span class="s1"><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/07/15/freckle-partners-airkast-dt4/">Freckle beacons want you to get your ESPN on</a></span></em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Merchants also benefit from the app. They share two mobile offers per week with Shop and Ride app users. Xerox provides the merchants with real-time tracking of deal conversions and anonymized data – such as the number of users who save, open and redeem the coupons. This allows merchants to make data-driven decisions based on which offers resonate most with consumers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The app grew out of research conducted at Xerox's storied R&amp;D facility <a href="http://www.parc.com/"><span class="s2">PARC</span></a>, working in concert with other Xerox <a href="https://www.xerox.com/en-us/innovation"><span class="s2">innovation</span></a> efforts helping transportation customers integrate mobile technology into their offerings. Shop and Ride joins other Xerox urban mobility projects being deployed around the world. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Earlier this year, Xerox launched <a href="https://www.news.xerox.com/news/City-of-LA-introduces-new-Xerox-Go-LA-app"><span class="s2">Go LA</span></a>, <a href="https://www.news.xerox.com/news/City-of-Denver-introduces-new-Xerox-Go-Denver-app"><span class="s2">Go Denver</span></a> and recently Go Bangalore to encourage multimodal transportation. These apps capture all available transportation options in the city and compute the shortest, cheapest and most sustainable ways to reach a commuter’s destination. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Belying their office product and photocopying history, Xerox is also a leading provider of <a href="http://services.xerox.com/transportation-solutions/enus.html"><span class="s2">transportation technology services</span></a> worldwide, including tolling, parking, mass transit and photo enforcement services, supporting governments in more than 30 countries.</span></p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/umXvFWU_Wto" width="600" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h2>Beacons are becoming routine for retail</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">German lottery operator Westdeutsche Lotterie (WestLotto) is piloting a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon solution to attract consumers into 60 outlets at which they can buy lottery tickets. The system, provided by Berlin-based technology company Sensorberg, delivers coupons and other location-based content to WestLotto app users, and then tracks whether those individuals enter stores and make purchases based on those offers.</span></p>
<p class="p1">As well, <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/06/29/yap-looks-take-onpayment-beacons-pt1/">South Korea's YAP</a> is looking westward to expand after conquering Vietnam and China, with a beacon network aimed at storefront retailers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Crowdfunding is a noisy, cruel and crowded place, particularly in hardware where some ideas soar to great fruition and others bomb abysmally. There there's those that leverage a decent amount of support but are hampered by long delays. Many of those funded struggle to scale and bring their creations to market in a timely manner, leaving the crowdfunders impatient and frustrated.

But it's worth remembering that crowdfunding is an egalitarian market place with a few gems and a few products that are just so bizarre they blow my mind, <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/07/31/calm-cruel-connected-julys-best-worst-iot/">particularly in the IoT space</a>.

So take a look at these:

&nbsp;
<h2>Mine Kafon Drone</h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-5992 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/the-mine-kafon-drone-1024x576.jpg" alt="the-mine-kafon-drone" width="1024" height="576" />

With the proliferation of air strikes and chemical warfare, it would be easy to think of land mines as a problem of another era. Yet every day at least 10 people around the world lose their life or limb to a landmine or another explosive remnant of war with over <a title="Treaty Status" href="http://www.icbl.org/en-gb/the-treaty/treaty-status.aspx" target="_blank">60 countries</a> around the world  contaminated by landmines. Pokemon Go players in Bosnia have even been warned to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/20/pokemon-go-players-in-bosnia-warned-to-steer-clear-of-landmines"> avoid certain areas</a> which may be home to unexploded mines.

Up until now, traditional de-mining systems have been operated by humans or animals and are costly and slow, not to mention dangerous. The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/massoudhassani/mine-kafon-drone?ref=category">Mine Kafon Drone </a>(MKD) flies over dangerous areas to map, detect and detonate landmines from a safe distance. The drone works autonomously equipped with three separate interchangeable robotic extensions.

These three methodologies combined makes the MKD up to 20 times faster than traditional de-mining technologies. As well as being safer, it also up to 200 times cheaper. MKD has several working prototypes which have been tested extensively, including tests in conjunction with the Dutch Ministry of Defense. This project is a fantastic example of IoT technology being used to solve a critical problem.

<em>Verdict: HUGE Hit</em>
<h2>Super Brain II</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-5995 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/tumblr_inline_oaqj94KzpO1ra7u74_540.jpg" alt="tumblr_inline_oaqj94KzpO1ra7u74_540" width="540" height="304" />

The trend of wearables to aid sleep have been matched by those that aim to help us focus our busy minds when undertaking important work. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1987764045/super-brain-ii?ref=category_popular">Super Brain II</a> claims to act as an alternative to "costly smart drugs," a problem compounded, according to the product's creator:
<blockquote> "...because smart drugs are too expensive in some countries, the issue has been raised that students from wealthy families have an advantage over students from ordinary households in achieving good grades."</blockquote>
Super Brain Ⅱ is a brain wave focused device that utilizes a magnetic headband. The creators claim it stimulates the creation of alpha, SMR, theta and delta waves by altering the frequency of magnetic fields. It's based on the findings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_O._Becker">Dr Robert O. Becker</a>, anti-EMF (electro magnetic field) activist, researcher and surgeon. The creators appear particularly encouraged by his research on cats that found they react significantly to magnetic influence.

I struggled through the promo video so you don't have to -- a true act of endurance, thanks to the creepy background muzak that plays on a loop and the audio voiceover that fails to sync with the presenter's mouth movements. The rather unfortunate 70's-looking wearable headband is not helped by the people dancing in the meadows whilst wearing it in the video.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation">Transcranial Magnet Stimulation</a> has been used since 2008 to treat  serious, pervasive conditions like chronic pain, pharmaceutical resistant depression, fibromyalgia, OCD, Parkinson's, and schizophrenia. It however relies on ongoing treatment under the management of a health professional. While there is nothing intrinsically dangerous with Super Brain II's low voltage device, there is no compelling argument as to its efficacy considering devices in a medical setting rely on large machinery to be able to get through the skin and skull of the brain.

The product previously sort funding as "Super Brain I" but according to the creators, it was suspended as they send too many messages that were "considered spam."

<em>Verdict: Miss </em>
<h2>Omega 2</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-5991 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/6c15c56111eae091b957a1640ea8e56e_original.png" alt="6c15c56111eae091b957a1640ea8e56e_original" width="680" height="452" />

<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/onion/omega2-5-iot-computer-with-wi-fi-powered-by-linux?ref=home_featured">Omega 2</a> is a Linux computer designed specifically for building connected hardware applications. It combines the tiny form factor and power efficiency of the Arduino with the power and flexibilities of the Raspberry Pi. Sure there are a plethora of tiny computers floating around, but at this kind of price, even if you never end up using it yourself, having it sit in a prominent place in your office just might inspire someone else to create something awesome.

<em>Verdict: Hit</em>
<h2>VylyV</h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-5953 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/digital-pelvic-floor-trainer-shorts-1024x538.jpg" alt="digital-pelvic-floor-trainer-shorts" width="1024" height="538" />

You may recall I reviewed a wearable product called <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/07/31/calm-cruel-connected-julys-best-worst-iot/">Elvie</a> last month designed to provide exercise therapy for women with pelvic floor dysfunction. Well, gender doesn't always discriminate, now there's a connected pair of shorts that's designed to exercise male kegel muscles with the aim of boosting the wearer's "manhood." The founder Michael Wales, claims he hit on the idea after trying 20 penis enlargement devices (yes, 20). We writers love a story and this is one of the best bios I've read:
<blockquote>"Founder Michael, an avid gym-goer and men’s health enthusiast, always believed that ‘bigger is better.’ After trying over 20 penis enlargement devices, he realized in 2014 that pelvic floor exercises are the best approach to boost manhood..."</blockquote>
The shorts come with some tall claims including their ability to "entrench the hardness and glow with powerful ejaculations" and "unlock the mysterious quest for the most wanted experience of multiple orgasms." They are equipped with sensors and a wireless tracker and there's a companion app where the player can train the character "DerpBut" to run away from "HemorrhED."

You can even buy two or more pairs of shorts, enabling you to train your, um, manhood, with your friends.

All puns and joking aside, exercising one's kegel muscles is a good thing. But the requirement for a special pair of shorts seems rather extraneous.

<em>Verdict: Miss</em>
<h2>COWAROBOT R1</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-5994 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/the-cowarobot-r1-is-a-carryon-suitcase-that-automatically-follows-you_1.jpg" alt="the-cowarobot-r1-is-a-carryon-suitcase-that-automatically-follows-you_1" width="720" height="479" />

Regular travelers know the pain of lugging around a wheelie suitcase. It can not only leave you with a stiff shoulder or wrenched arm but also the pain of longing for a hands free experience. Enter a robotic suitcase that utilizes a camera sensor and Bluetooth to follow its owner on their journey. The <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cowarobot-r1-the-first-and-only-robotic-suitcase-travel-technology--2#/">Cowarobot</a> moves at a speed of 4.5 mph and is equipped for 12.5 miles of walking before needing a charge. It comes with a keyless locking function, can charge your devices and is equipped to dodge obstacles in its path.

Its price is a not unreasonable $400 and it's easy to predict such suitcases becoming cheaper as they gain traction in the marketplace. If it only came with silent wheels to avoid a 4 a.m. wakeup thanks to noisy travelers walking on cobblestoned streets, it could be a huge hit.

<em>Verdict: Hit</em>
<h2>Kiss Phone</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-6007 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/376306-kissinger-650.jpg" alt="376306-kissinger-650" width="650" height="366" />
With the abundant range of projects one could run a crowdfunding campaign for, it's bizarre to see one that has been tried but failed. It's been a while since I wrote about the <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/02/12/haptic-valentines-day/">Kissenger</a>, a connected device to send a kiss to someone far away. However the idea hasn't gone away, with an idea by another for a few device, the Kiss Phone described as "a great challenging idea which could reform the world or at least move the behavior of people to a more colorized direction."

To be fair, if you're the kind of person who likes to enter a project from its earliest days, then this could be one for you follow. With the trends in robotics and haptic technology, who knows how we'll show affection in the future?!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[According to the <a href="http://www.womensheart.org/content/HeartDisease/gender_differences.asp">Women's Heart Foundation</a>, coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in women. More than twice as many women die from cardiovascular disease as from all forms of cancer combined. Evaluation for suspected coronary disease differs in women because of frequently misleading results provided by treadmill testing without imaging. Gender differences have been observed in treatment practices, and the optimal approach for women has yet to be established.

<a href="http://yourwanda.com/">Wanda Health</a> is a predictive analytics firm that focuses on the treatment and prevention of chronic disease such a heart disease, by developing <div id="kRy9OcUIp" style="width: 311px"><a href="http://www.laviagraes.com/viagra-componentes-quimicos">http://www.laviagraes.com/viagra-componentes-quimicos</a></div> formulas to efficiently leverage precision medicine.  This week they announced the launch of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mywanda/id1125216315?ls=1&amp;mt=8">myWanda</a>, the first and only mobile application specifically aimed at empowering women to improve the health of their hearts.

<img class="size-large wp-image-5950 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/1-1024x812.png" alt="1" width="1024" height="812" />

myWanda delivers personalized support for developing heart healthy behaviors. The app encourages women to set specific lifestyle goals known as “Pathways” for exercise, nutrition, sleep, stress management, and hydration. myWanda then delivers daily tips, advice, and inspiration to help women stay on track to achieve these goals, thereby creating measurable improvements to their heart health and overall well-being.
<h2>myWanda simplifies patients' lives</h2>
Although heart disease is the number one killer of women in America, approximately 80 percent of cases are preventable through education and lifestyle changes. This is where myWanda comes in – leveraging data science, applied medical research, and proven engagement methodologies to deliver support through an engaging, visually-driven mobile interface.

Wanda is dedicated to simplifying and improving the lives of individuals with chronic conditions, blending predictive analytics and behavioral science to enrich the remote health and patient management experience.<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mywanda/id1125216315?ls=1&amp;mt=8"> myWanda is the company’s first consumer app</a>, featuring a leading-class personalized communication strategy that makes it easy for women to receive support, education, and guidance. Wanda’s digital health platform collects critical information from individuals and utilizes machine learning to deliver ongoing risk analysis and decision support.

“We’re excited to bring a technology solution to market that can truly inform, motivate, and support women to take better care of their hearts — and potentially save lives in the process,” said Wanda CEO Steve Curd.

“At Wanda, our approach has always been crystal-clear: how do we translate the most advanced technological capabilities into human-centered solutions,” according to CCO Mark Heinemeyer. “The myWanda app truly embodies the vision of harnessing powerful technologies to improve people’s lives.”  Heinemeyer further notes that Wanda intends to sync myWanda with multiple wearable devices in the future and that myWanda will soon accept data from many of the popular personal fitness wearable devices.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="mol-para-with-font">The notion of smart dust sounds like a work of science fiction but scientists at <a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/08/03/sprinkling-of-neural-dust-opens-door-to-electroceuticals/">University of California Berkeley</a> have developed a "neural dust" that can be implanted into the body, to monitor internal nerves, muscles or organs in real time.</p>
The sensors are about the size of a large grain of sand contain a piezoelectric crystal that converts ultrasound vibrations from outside the body into electricity to power a tiny, on-board transistor that is in contact with a nerve or muscle fiber. A voltage spike in the fiber alters the circuit and the vibration of the crystal, which changes the echo detected by the ultrasound receiver, typically the same device that generates the vibrations. The slight change, called backscatter, allows them to determine the voltage.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The research could one day lead to brain machine interfaces for controlling prosthetics and robotics as well as faciliate a new biohealth industry of "electroceuticals."</p>

<blockquote>“The original goal of the neural dust project was to imagine the next generation of brain-machine interfaces, and to make it a viable clinical technology,” said neuroscience graduate student Ryan Neely. “If a paraplegic wants to control a computer or a robotic arm, you would just implant this electrode in the brain and it would last essentially a lifetime.”</blockquote>
Contemporary implantable electrodes degrade within 1 to 2 years, and all connect to wires that pass through holes in the skull. Wireless sensors could be sealed in stopping  unwanted movement of the electrodes and prevention of infection.

<h2>Is smart dust the pinnacle of IoT creativity?</h2>
Research by <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3114217">Gartner</a> into 'hype cycles' within emerging technology predicts that Smart Dust will become trend within 5 to 10 years. It's a field that has been developing within research laboratories <a href="http://robotics.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pister/SmartDust/">since the late 1990's</a>, with funding by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/">(DARPA)</a> to create applications of military relevance, their work involving "evolutionary and revolutionary advances in miniaturization, integration, and energy management."

<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2581821/mobile-wireless/smart-dust.html">As early as 2003</a>, researchers were working on applications for smart dust, which they characterised "tiny wireless microelectromechanical sensors (MEMS) that can detect everything from light to vibrations". Commercial applications considered included serving as traffic sensors in congested urban areas and monitoring the power consumption of household appliances to determine whether they're operating at peak efficiency. However, scientific advances have moved the smart dust motes from everyday sensor technology applications to implanted wearable devices.

According to neuroscientist Jose Carmena:
<blockquote>“The beauty is that now, the sensors are small enough to have a good application in the peripheral nervous system, for bladder control or appetite suppression, for example. The technology is not really there yet to get to the 50-micron target size, which we would need for the brain and central nervous system. Once it’s clinically proven, however, neural dust will just replace wire electrodes. This time, once you close up the brain, you’re done.“</blockquote>
The team at work to miniaturize the device further, find more biocompatible materials and improve the surface transceiver that sends and receives the ultrasounds, ideally using beam-steering technology to focus the sounds waves on individual motes. They are now building little backpacks for rats to hold the ultrasound transceiver that will record data from implanted motes.
<h2>"Dust" could also detect chemical levels</h2>
They’re also working to expand the motes’ ability to detect non-electrical signals, such as oxygen or hormone levels.
<div id="attachment_58094" class="wp-caption alignright">.</div>
“The vision is to implant these neural dust motes anywhere in the body, and have a patch over the implanted site send ultrasonic waves to wake up and receive necessary information from the motes for the desired therapy you want,” said Dongjin Seo, a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer sciences. “Eventually you would use multiple implants and one patch that would ping each implant individually, or all simultaneously.”

The biggest barrier to the mainstreaming of smart dust is perhaps the reality that at present, it requires surgical implanting. Will it be possible in the future to swallow or inhale the dust? Our digestive system makes it highly questionable, but it's an interesting idea. At any rate, as the dust gets smaller, it's entry into the central nervous system and brain could lead to life changing interventions for people with particular health conditions and disabilities. It'll be a way off, but if the research so far is anything to go by, it's inevitable.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>"If one crappy robot and another crappy robot fought each other -- what would happen?"</em>

In an era where robots like <a href="https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/cool-robots/nao">Nao</a>, <a href="https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/cool-robots/pepper">Pepper</a>, <a href="http://www.hansonrobotics.com/robot/sophia/">Sophia</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVlhMGQgDkY">Atlas</a> manage to amaze us with their respective abilities to walk, learn, communicate in different languages,  recognize different people and partake in heavy lifting, another suite of robots is hard at work lowering the bar of robotic achievement.

<a href="http://portal.nifty.com/hebocon/">Hebocon</a> is an annual robot competition for the technically ungifted where 31 robots compete in sumo style wrestling matches where the robots try to push their competitors off a board through a combination of pushing, shoving, whirring and sheer persistence. The biggest challenge can be getting robots to move at all, let alone deliver attack moves and self-defence techniques.  The World Championship was recently held in Tokyo.

<em><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/07/06/humans-robots-agriculture-swap-it4/">Will robots finally take farmers' jobs?</a></em>

The word Hebocon derives from the Japanese word <em>Heboi</em>, used to describe something that is technically poor, or low in quality and with this spirit in mind, robots are made with a bizarre array of equipment including fast food wrappers, instant noodle containers, sex toys, wind up toys and Barbie dolls.  According to the organisers, "entrants will need compromise and surrender instead of ideas and technical skill." Robots are actually penalised for having high tech features and assistance from the maker is not unusual in the competition, such as a helping finger to get the robot moving when a motor has failed. It a competition where failures in technical output can be thwarted by strategy and dogged persistence.

The souls of robots that would be considered scrapheap fodder are respected, as winners in each round opt to attach parts of the losing robots to 'carry on the will' of those knocked out.

Hong Kong representative Kit da Studio won the NicoTsuku award with his table-flipping robot. (The robot actually flipped itself over when it was trying to flip the desk.) Overall winner, Ricky Chan, built a robot called the "Robot-Controlled Controller Robot," which consists of two components – a controller that looks like a tiger robot, and a robot that looks like a controller.

&nbsp;

<img class="size-full wp-image-6121 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/7b8783698e79830a515760e0f5a046b4.jpg" alt="7b8783698e79830a515760e0f5a046b4" width="921" height="502" />

Since the first competition held in 2014 in Tokyo, Hebocon has spread over 25 countries and over 60 competitions has been hosted. In the latest International contest in August, participants hailed from Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Iceland, France and Hungary. It's easy to mock the Hebocon awards for comedy effect alone, but the reality is that they bring robotics (albeit in it's most primitive form) to those who either lack technical ability or might be creatively or technically blocked. As the creators encourage:
<blockquote>" Go into a toy store and buy one of those moving toy dogs, rip off its exterior, and stick some cardboard on there, and you’d be looking at your original robot. Get some pieces of wood, sharpen them, and give your robot some horns: your robot’s attacking ability has just sky-rocketed. You might even get more creative and install a motorized weapon onto your robot.

That’s Okay! That is what we call Heboi. Grab that faulty robot of yours, and participate in a Hebocon competition!"</blockquote>
With sponsors like Arduino and Maker Faire and a cult following, it brings a sort of robotics to the masses.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Is the Cybathlon the future of the Paralympics?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.rio2016.com/en/paralympics/sports">2016 Paralympics</a> kicking off in a couple of weeks, highly trained athletes are preparing for a range of competitive events that pit people with similar disabilities against each other in 528 events sports including wheelchair basketball, blind rugby and canoe sprints.

But as sports training and equipment becomes more technologically advanced, some are asking question about the place of technology in the Paralympics.

After <a href="https://www.paralympic.org/vista-2013">VISTA 2013 themed that year on "Equipment and Technology in Paralympic Sports</a>", speaker, participants and sports enthusiasts were asking about the parity of equipment in the Paralympics given the cost of highly advanced technology. Some questioned whether the more wealthy countries would dominate the medal tables as they potentially have more money to develop "performance enhancing" technology. Others questioned the role of science and technology and whether it would surpass the raw ability of the athlete.

Brendan Burkett, an ex-Paralympian swimmer and now professor in biomechanics at the University of the Sunshine Coast commented:
<blockquote>
<div>"But we still need to keep the essence of the sport. We need to keep that while also improving the functionality of the sport. We don't want the sports to be inhibited by robots, though. We want them to always be controlled by the humans."</div></blockquote>
This is further challenged by a lack of sponsorship for individual competitors, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/17/paralympic-ticket-sales-slow-as-fears-mount">low ticket sales</a> and limited television access compared to the Olympic games.

But one event is taking a different approach.

The inaugural <a href="http://www.cybathlon.ethz.ch/">Cybathlon</a> kicks off on October 8 in Zurich, Switzerand and will see 74 athletes from 25 countries competing to show how robotic technology helps them in their daily lives. Competitors are referred to as "pilots" and depending on their disability, they compete in a series of tasks to test their agility, dexterity and speed.
<h2>Obstacle courses with prosthetics and wheelchairs</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-6184 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-08-23-at-19.08.27.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2016-08-23 at 19.08.27" width="538" height="304" />

In the respective obstacle courses, four pilots compete simultaneously on parallel tracks against each other to solve six tasks in the shortest time. For example, in the obstacle course with prosthetic legs, different step sequences and movements must be carried out such as climbing stars and walking across a beam. Those with prosthetic arms must demonstrate dexterity with a range of fine motor skills tasks.

In the motorized wheelchair course, wheelchairs which are controlled by joystick, tongue control, touchpad or by other technologies are approved and their pilots are encouraged in small teams to develop innovative solutions to everyday access challenges such as <span class="goog-text-highlight">building inputs with thresholds, uneven pavements or steep ramps. Eligible athletics include those with </span>various types of spinal cord injuries, bilateral leg amputations or other serious injuries that make walking impossible.

For Cybathlon, the most comfortable and most agile exoskeletons are sought which enable pilots to perform various everyday movements easily and reliably - even climbing stairs or walking on uneven terrain. Only pilots with complete leg paralysis due to a spinal cord injury can participate competing on simultaneous parallel tracks.

<div class="image-credit-wrapper"></div>
<div class="image-credit-wrapper">

Brain-computer interfaces are able to detect brain signals enabling people with various levels of paralysis to move things with their mind. In virtual racing the pilot utilizes thought control to control characters -- or avatars -- in a specially developed computer game. The pilots must send the appropriate signals at the right moment so that their avatars jump over obstacles or accelerate. False signals lead to a slow down or a clash. Most teams use the electroencephalography (EEG) for detecting brain signals, but other methods such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) are permitted.

The Cybathlon is designed to provide a platform for the development of novel, practical assistive technologies whilst breaking down barriers between people with disabilities, the public and technology developers. It's not turning people into cyborgs but it is an opportunity to participate in an event with the world's most ground breaking access technology.

It'll be interesting to see it's impact on the Paralympics and whether it attracts people audiences and sponsors to the innovative world of adaptive technology.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[An $12.3 million smart bridge, opening this October, is being built in northern Bavaria and will include technology never seen before on the German Autobahn.

Sensors built into the bridge on the Autobahn 9, <div id="EObjFuElFB2MSbKyHGiL" style="width: 236px"><a href="http://www.laviagraes.com/foro-viagra-femenina">http://www.laviagraes.com/foro-viagra-femenina</a></div> will capture and analyze data such as the strain, movements and inclinations of the bridge, as well as the temperature, humidity and pressure from vehicles. Experts will then be able to tell the state of the bridge according to the data they receive, with the aim of discovering damage before regular tests.

The bridge in Nuremberg will be tested out as a five-year pilot project to determine whether it might also work in the rest of Germany.
<h2>New bridge part of the digital autobahn test field</h2>
The new bridge is part of the <a href="http://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2015/084-dobrindt-startet-digitales-testfeld-autobahn.html?nn=134500">"Digital Autobahn Test Field,"</a> a project which the government launched in 2015.  The A9 between Munich and Nuremberg, one of the most important traffic routes in Europe, is gradually being transformed into a test route for innovations. Using the slogan "Mobility 4.0", the German Federal Government, the Free State of Bavaria and companies such as Siemens and Infineon, are developing the A9 into a proving ground for the technologies of the future.

The aim is make driving faster, safer and reduce congestion. <a href="http://www.siemens.com/innovation/en/home/pictures-of-the-future/mobility-and-motors/urban-mobility-radar-technology-for-highways.html">Another advantage of the project is that it could reduce the number of <em>Geisterfahrer </em></a>- ghost drivers, or those who enter the road on an exit and drive against the flow of traffic. By warning these people and other drivers of the mistake they are about to make, the system will increase safety for what is a recurrent problem on German roads.

The digital project also involves introducing free Wi-Fi access in six different parking lots of the north Bavarian region which will be available from mid-November.

<h2>Bridge moves vehicle safety improvements outside of the car?</h2>
While automobile manufacturers are concentrating on creating self driving cars, traffic planners are looking to develop an intelligent road infrastructure that will direct vehicles but also actively communicate with them. The German Ministry’s aim is to create a platform ready for introducing and testing additional vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and <a href="http://www.esk.fraunhofer.de/en/media/press_releases/pm1510.html">vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication features</a>.

Radar sensors is utilized in the project, controlled by modern 77 GHz microchips made by <a href="https://www.infineon.com/">Infineon</a>. They have already formed an integral part of driver assistance systems for some years and can for example, maintain a constant distance to the vehicle ahead, and initiate or automatically perform emergency braking. They will make it possible to guide vehicles to an emergency stop on the bridge if a vehicle’s sensor system fails, removing the need for emergency braking.

A second signal could simultaneously be sent out to warn other vehicles to keep a safe distance away. Obviously, this would avoid any interruption to the flow of traffic.

<em><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/08/13/connected-cars-need-play-well-smart-cities-tl4/">Connected cars need to play well with smart cities</a></em>

Many companies are interested in testing new technologies on the route with test vehicles from Audi, Mercedes and BMW are already using their on-board computers to regularly make their way through heavy traffic on the A9. The highway’s communication network is also being tested, including the ability of the system to warn vehicles on the A9 in good time before they attempt risky passing maneuvers.

In addition, technology from the <a href="http://www.esk.fraunhofer.de/en.html">Fraunhofer Research Institution for Communication Systems and Continental</a> is making it possible for a vehicle to warn the cars behind it that it is about to brake – even before the brake lights go on. Such capabilities are designed to provide drivers with alternative routes and warn them of impending dangers.

Upon project completion, Siemens and Infineon will release all test data in <div id="0TDxouj5ZBhBDDIMC" style="width: 372px"><a href="http://www.viagragenericoes24.com/tipo-de-viagra-natural">http://www.viagragenericoes24.com/tipo-de-viagra-natural</a></div> an open source format. “The idea is that creative minds from the automotive industry, the digital sector, and the scientific community will be able to use the data generated from this project to develop additional innovative mobility solutions,” says <a href="http://www.siemens.com/innovation/en/home/pictures-of-the-future/mobility-and-motors/urban-mobility-radar-technology-for-highways.html">Marcus Zwick,</a> who responsible for Siemens Mobility's technology incubator. It'll be interesting to see what innovations develop on the intelligent autobahn.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Rithmio gathers new data on Paralympic athletes and trainers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the first time, a Paralympic team is getting data on the athletes’ movements instead of data on the wheelchair only thanks to <a href="http://www.rithmio.com/">Rithmio</a>, a leading motion recognition company.

Rithmio was founded in 2014 when doctoral student Adam Tilton partnered with his academic advisor Prashant Mehta, an associate professor of mechanical science and engineering to found a start-up focused on gesture and activity recognition. Recently, Rithmio has partnered with coach Adam Bleakney of U.S. Paralympic wheelchair racing and cycling athletes (and four-time Paralympian) to train the athletes that will compete in the Paralympic Games in Rio.

Through a wearable tech tool called Cadence Counter, Bleakney is able to get real-time cadence feedback that helps him understand his athlete’s stroke efficiency while training. This benefits athletes such as <a href="http://www.teamusa.org/para-track-and-field/athletes/Joshua-George">Josh George</a>, gold, silver and bronze medal winner in the track and field at the Paralympics and competing this year in Rio.

I spoke with Adam Tilton, CEO and co-founder of Rithmio to learn more. He explained:
<blockquote>“ A Cadence Counter is an application that allows a Paralympic athlete to measure their personal cadence. Up until now there has been no measurement device that wheelchair athletes can wear in the chair that are accurate. They have all been measuring the movements of the chair not the person in the chair.

Cadence is used in training, for example, an athlete might be told to 'go at 70 strokes per minute and do that for 60 secs, 140 for 30 seconds' and previously the athlete would use a metronome need to guess those measurements are supposed to be. What our application does for them is that they wear a smart watch on the wrist with a corresponding app on their phone and now can do exactly that number”.</blockquote>
According to Bleakney, this is a metric that he’s been waiting for for a decade; his entire career he’s wanted to be able to have cadence.

<em><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/08/16/athletes-wearable-opinions-dl4/">Rio 2016 athletes want more out of their wearables</a></em>

Tilton went on to detail:
<blockquote>“What this means in a race is if you are coming up to a turn due to the chair’s acceleration or if there’s a wind shift, the athlete will know they are able to go into a turn and a wind shift so what they will do is want to adjust their cadence before that happens. e.g. increase their cadence before going into a headwind to be sure they maintain their pace.

In a longer race, depending on where they are, if they are in front of the pack or the back, they will know what their most efficient cadence is and they will learn this over time. Just as we learn the beat to our favourite song, they can train to hit a cadence at their optimal efficiency and then they can recreate that cadence when they’re out on the track."</blockquote>
Tilton said he and his team had a number of challenges in creating the cadence counter:
<blockquote>"The primary challenge in wearables is how do you automate the identification of something interesting? How do you build a system that can identify when something important is taking place and ignore all the other things? For example, in the gym it's a very complicated problem because an athlete might do 900 plus exercises in a workout and then you have the problem of excluding other things that are not exercises that you don’t want to track such as moving between exercise machines or drinking from the water fountain.

The second challenge is being able to do advanced analysis. A lot of the exercise monitoring wearable devices today are reasonably good at counting steps but the problem is, if you do anything else (like sit in a moving train or on a boat) it counts the movement as steps. When it does measure actual steps, it gives you the step count, but it's not telling you about how you are walking. Our products provide very precise motion recognition so that any change in the way a user performs an action is detected."

<img class="size-large wp-image-6475 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8209-1024x683.jpg" alt="IMG_8209" width="1024" height="683" /></blockquote>
While the Cadence Counter is currently utilized by athletes competing in wheelchair racing and cycling, it could be transferred to other Paralympic sports such as swimming and gymnastics -- if a sport is based on motion our technology could be easily applied.

The relationship between sports and technology is an interesting one, with some contending that <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/08/28/cyborg-olympics-future-paralympics-hl1/">we need to be careful to maintain the essence of sport</a> rather than provide increased athletic ability to Paralympians.

"What we’re developing are solutions that allow us to get better data to make better decisions around the athlete so we’re allowing the athlete to see things that they might not otherwise see," said Tilton, clarifying Rithmio's key difference. "And I think that technology is going to drive a lot of improvements between sports and athletes, also within safety helping us understand how injures might occur."

He added:
<blockquote>"I think the technology and athletics have always had a very close relationship and I think a lot of interesting developments in sport have been the result of new types of technology such as statistics and video cameras. I think it's interesting that the U.S Paralympic Committee has an entire division creating the dots between coaches needs, athletes needs and the Paralympics, really seeking out what is on the bleeding edge to connect the right technology with the right athletes and just do R and D. High precision wearable training devices can protect an athlete from injury and potentially extend their career."</blockquote>
Here's hoping that Josh and his teammates can bring home medals again at this year's Paralympics. It would be a testament to the technology that companies like Rithmio are bringing to athletic training.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We live in a society where human health is increasingly enhanced by artificial augmentation and implantation including hip replacements and hearing aids. French company <a href="http://www.carmatsa.com/en/">Carmat</a> have been working for 15 years on the artificial heart, a device that completely replaces the human heart in people with end stage heart disease and a life expectancy of less than two weeks without the surgery.

They've recently announced their <a href="///Users/catelawrence/Downloads/CP_CARMAT_demarrage-PIVOT_vf.pdf">second trial,</a> commencing in 2017 with the aim to achieve European approval for their device.  The Carmat device differs to other robotic heart devices as it is meant to be used in cases of terminal heart failure, instead of being used as a bridge device while the patient awaits a transplant.
<h2>How it works</h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-6727 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/phoca_thumb_l_03.jpg" alt="phoca_thumb_l_03" width="640" height="480" />

In Carmat's design, two chambers are each divided by a membrane that holds hydraulic fluid on one side. A motorized pump moves hydraulic fluid in and out of the chambers, and that fluid causes the membrane to move; blood flows through the other side of each membrane. The blood-facing side of the membrane is made of tissue obtained from a sac that surrounds a cow's heart, to make the device more biocompatible.

The Carmat device also uses valves made from cow heart tissue and has sensors to detect increased pressure within the device. That information is sent to an internal control system that can adjust the flow rate in response to increased demand, such as when a patient is exercising.

<img class="size-large wp-image-6726 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/phoca_thumb_l_A4300Dpi-1.jpg" alt="phoca_thumb_l_A4300Dpi-1" width="500" height="354" />
<p class="titre_conseil">The heart is connected to external systems; a power supply, monitoring and hospital control system for the post-operative period and subsequent outpatient visits and a portable or wearable power supply and communication system for the patient to return home.</p>

<h2>A new heart is not an exact science</h2>
<p class="titre_conseil">So far, the success of their artificial heart transplants has been couched in research terms with success in the previous four person feasibility trial defined as survival at 30 days. Their model has been trialled on four people all of which have died.</p>
<p class="titre_conseil">Carmat's <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20140303-first-patient-fitted-with-carmat-artificial-heart-dies">first</a> transplant patient, died in March 2014, two-and-a-half months after his operation apparently due to a device failure. The <a href="http://www.qmed.com/news/fourth-patient-treated-carmat-artificial-heart-dies">second </a><span class="goog-text-highlight">died in May 2015, nine months after </span><span class="goog-text-highlight">having</span><span class="goog-text-highlight"> been grafted. These two deaths had been caused by "micro-leakage of the blood area to the operating liquid of the prosthesis" having created a "disturbance electronic engine control" of the artificial heart, according to the <a class="lien_interne rub" title="All the analyzes news" href="http://www.lemonde.fr/analyses/">analysis</a> of Carmat.</span></p>
<p class="titre_conseil">The <a href="///Users/catelawrence/Downloads/151222_pr_carmat_dec_2015_vf_eng_3.pdf">third</a> died after nine months due to "respiratory arrest during chronic renal failure” and the patient was suffering “from a combination of severe diseases, especially kidney failure already diagnosed prior to implantation of the prosthesis and warranting regular hospital visits.” It was also stated that the heart continued to beat after the patient had died and that “the medical team turned off the prosthetic device on confirmation of the patient’s death.” The <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/sante/article/2016/01/21/mort-du-quatrieme-patient-greffe-du-c-ur-artificiel-de-carmat_4850749_1651302.html">fourth</a> and final patient died from medical complications associated with his critical pre- and post-operative state</p>
<p class="p p2">The company is now pushing on with a trial aimed at securing European approval. It will enroll 25 patients and this time the endpoint will be survival at three months. Says Marcello Conviti, CEO of Carmat:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p p2">“Our target is to have all the data submitted by the end of 2017 and commercial availability in selected CE mark countries at the beginning of 2018,”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What is the future?</h2>
Clearly we're a long way from the dreams of futurist tech predictors that for see a future where one's heart beat could be regulated through their smartphone.  Transhumanist Zoltan Istvan  sees a future where "artificial hearts will be Wi-Fi-enabled and could be sped up with a smartphone to have wild sex when you want it and sped down to sleep better at night." according to the <em><a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/brain-implants-robotic-hearts-transhumanist-zoltan-istvans-technology-predictions-2025-1533209">International Business Times</a>. </em> He goes on to concede that there's a potential risk that an artificial heart could be hacked.

There is however no demonstrable evidence that an artificial heart (or <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/go-ahead-hackers-break-heart/">pacemaker </a>for the matter) could be hacked. But the <em>fear</em> of course, is real. For example  in 2014,  former Vice President Dick Cheney revealed that his doctor ordered the wireless functionality of his heart implant disabled due to<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2013/10/21/yes-terrorists-could-have-hacked-dick-cheneys-heart/"> fears it might be hacked in an assassination attempt</a>. Other research reveals that medical devices such as insulin pumps are<a href="http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm446809.htm"> vulnerable to security breaches</a>, which places connected biomechanic and robotic devices in a uneasy space considering their functional capabilities are to assist the health of the seriously ill.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the last week Berlin has been home to <a href="http://www.ifa-berlin.de/">IFA</a>, Europe's answer to the <a href="https://www.ces.tech/">Consumer Electronics Show (CES)</a>. It features all the usual big name electronics that are household names internationally, along with brands you'll only be able to buy in Europe or Asia and a smattering of smaller start-ups sharing booths with likeminded enterprises and a brand.

It is amongst the latter that I came across <a href="http://smarter.am/">Smarter</a>, a UK-based business that is set to disrupt the increasingly high-tech industry of refrigeration.

<em><strong>See also:</strong></em> <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/07/14/smart-home-gadgets-too-expensive-vl4/"><em>Are prices driving away smart home consumers?</em></a>

Smarter used to show to launch their latest product <a href="http://fridgecam.squarespace.com/#details-1">TheFridgeCam</a>, a wireless fridge camera that allows users to see the contents of their <span class="il">fridge</span> from wherever they are via the app. The camera takes a photo of the contents of the fridge every time the door is shut, which is them displayed via the Smarter app.

Its features include:
<ul>
 	<li>Expiry reminders based on the fridge’s contents, ensuring items are used before they run out of date.</li>
 	<li>Receive replenishment notifications when you have run out of certain products, ensuring the user always has stock of the everyday essentials.</li>
 	<li>Set notifications for when the user is passing their favorite store.</li>
 	<li>Fully automated replenishment service, products can automatically be added to online shopping basket, allowing user to buy what they need, when they need it.</li>
 	<li>A recipe suggestion option allows the app to suggest recipes based on fridge’s remaining contents.</li>
 	<li>A temperature sensor notifies you if there is an adjustment in temperature, which could cause food to spoil, or indicating that the fridge door has been left open.</li>
</ul>
While smart fridges are something of a icon/cliche in the connected home development rush of the the last few years, the best thing about TheFridgeCam is the price. It retails at just $145, making it considerably cheaper to make your own fridge smart instead of the expense of replacing of the far pricier intelligent refrigerator options.
Now, let's look at some of the pricier options.
<div>
<h2>Samsung Family Hub</h2>
<img class="wp-image-6742 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/European-edition-of-Family-Hub_Main_1.jpg" alt="European-edition-of-Family-Hub_Main_1" width="599" height="399" />

Take for instance the Samsung Family Hub refrigerator, now available in Europe, in black to boot which also has a function to take photos inside the fridge. It is what it appears, a smart fridge which includes 21.5" touchscreen that can function as the family’s interactive "white board."

Through the Samsung Smart Home app, family members can share photos and memos in real time from wherever they are. Users can also synchronize their smartphone calendars and share each other’s schedules with their family through the Sticki app.

Samsung has partnered with various online grocery shopping services from all regions such as Eataly, and Supermercato24 in Europe. It's price starts and $5000USD depending on where and how you buy.

</div>
<div id="pageContainer2" class="page">
<div class="textLayer">
<div>
<h2>LG's InstaView Door in Door Refrigerator</h2>
<img class="wp-image-6748 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/b-rolllg-signature-fridge-1024x576.jpg" alt="b-rolllg-signature-fridge" width="790" height="444" />

Samsung is not the only company to offer a computer screen on your fridge. LG has now released a fridge complete with a 29" Windows 10 Surface computer on one of the doors and interestingly, made the screen transparent so users can see inside the fridge with two quick knocks on the glass.

This means in effect that you'll be able to see the products filling the shelves on the inside of the right-hand of its two doors. To be specific, you'll see the front labels of the products if they're put in backwards, that is with their labels facing inwards, but then when you open the door they'll be facing away from you. Not so appealing.

</div>
<div>

I can't be the only person thinking it might be far preferably to securely mount an iPad to the fridge door -- or another flat surface -- and spend the savings on a holiday?

But back to Smarter,  they're not a one-trick pony with previous home appliances under the belt achieving a number of awards including the <a href="http://www.greatbritishentrepreneurawards.com/2015-winners/">Great British Entrepreneur</a>, <a href="https://design100.com/LON15/winners_list.asp?studio=Smarter%20Applications%20Ltd">London Design award</a> and Best Innovative Company.<b>
</b>

CEO Christian Lane says:
<blockquote>“The FridgeCam will help users live and shop smarter. This is where the much talked about Internet of Things and Connected Products really start to have a positive effect on customers’ pockets and everyday lives."</blockquote>
This product shows that the little guys can disrupt big businesses, even in industries like electronics by focusing what people really need from connected products as opposed to what's for show.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Personal safety wearables <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/07/01/personal-safety-wearables-on-rise-dt4/">development and adoption</a> is on the rise with a range of wearable safety devices on the market like <a href="http://nimb.com/">Nimb</a>, <a href="https://revolar.com/">Revolar</a> and <a href="http://sirenring.com/">Siren</a>.

Their common thread is that they aim to enable the user to get help in situations where their personal safety is at risk but sending an alert to pre-selected friends or family, typically a text message which indicates that the wearer has activated their device, along with their GPS coordinates. The underlying premise is not new -- panic buttons have been around for some time.

But now they have become smaller, wearable and marketed to women in the case of unsafe situations.

<em><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/07/01/personal-safety-wearables-on-rise-dt4/">Emergency personal wearables use on the rise</a></em>

<a href="http://www.roarforgood.com/">ROAR for Good </a>created its first product, <a href="http://www.roarforgood.com/">Athena</a>, to create a simple way for women to get help. It's a discreet wearable that can be attached to a purse or worn as a necklace and has two capabilities: the activation of a loud alarm when the user presses a button, along with the corresponding alert to pre-determined contacts, and a silent mode so that Athena still sends information to contacts, using Twilio SMS, without making a sound.

I spoke with CEO Yasmine Mustafa about ROAR for Good and Athena and learned that the idea came about while talking to women during an extended period of international travel:
<blockquote>"While I was doing that trip, I got to know a lot of women and eventually I would learn about some kind of terrible situation where they had been abused or attacked. Then when I came back to Philadelphia, my neighbor was attacked a block from my apartment, she went out and she was attackedfrom behind. So, the idea was 'hey, this is what I want to do. I want to use technology to make self-defense tools better.' Before I started, I asked women about self-defense tools such as mace and personal alarms, if they used them, and if they didn't then why not. Women were concerned that they could accidentally use them against themselves or that they would going to be overpowered and they could be used as a weapon against them. We also needed something that with one click you could get right away, and then something you can use to get help. We decided text messaging was the quickest way to do that and worked with Twilio to integrate SMS capabilities into Athena."</blockquote>
Mustafa and her team worked hard at the functionality of Athena, offering the prototype to women in sororities and women’s shelters for critical feedback. Victim advocates, law enforcement, and counselors were consulted. She explained:
<blockquote>"The idea of the first mode, was just alarm mode. But when I started going and talking to women in sororities and shelters, I was surprised at the appeal of the silent mode, more than the alarm mode, especially in a threatening situation. That interested me enough and that's why we added the silent mode, and also because 80% of attacks to women are from someone that you know."</blockquote>
<h2>The main issue with personal emergency wearables</h2>
This is the crux of the contradiction of the personal safety alarm phenomenon.

They are chiefly are marketed for women in potentially unsafe situations like walking the street at night. Their creation is often reactive, instigated by a heavily reported violence crime or personal experience of the founder or their loved ones. For example, pre-wearables a slew of safety apps where created in Indian in 2012 in response to a case in New Delhi, India in 2012 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/world/asia/murder-charges-filed-against-5-men-in-india-gang-rape.html?hp&amp;_r=0">where a young woman was gang-raped and brutally assaulted by six men on a moving bus</a>.

This is at odds with two realities. Firstly, most women face violence in their own home at the hands of someone known to the victim such as a partner, family member or friend. Secondly, the victims of public crime are overwhelmingly <a href="http://victimsofcrime.org/docs/default-source/ncvrw2015/2015ncvrw_stats_assault.pdf?sfvrsn=2">young adult males</a>, although the lack of crime reporting let alone prosecution makes it difficult to get accurate statistics. Despite this there are no safety devices marketing to young men, although devices such as Athena are nondescript enough that could be worn by either gender.

Further, it is difficult to test the efficacy of personal safety devices. "We never had a circumstance where they had to use it right at that moment, we can't simulate an attack, it's not possible," Mustafa said.

However, Athena's strength is in its marketing for incidences of interpersonal violence beyond street violence. Mustafa noted:
<blockquote>"Women want to use it in situations where they think they might be at risk. We had women say: 'I'm going on a Tinder date and I've already told my friend she gets a message from me that I want her to come get me out of the date or that I want her to call me' or 'I'm on a study date or a study group, and this guy keeps putting his hand on my thigh, and I'm too uncomfortable to say something' or 'I'm worried about my safety and I want her to come interrupt the situation'.." The feedback we got about the silent mode was so interesting, either women not wanting to be aggressive enough, or they are and they want to be protected by someone right there in case something happens."</blockquote>

<h2>Can family and friends really be crime fighters?</h2>
It's worth noting that there are currently no technical capabilities that enable any personal wearable to directly call 911 in an emergency. Even car and <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/05/23/calm-cruel-connected-iot-hits-misses-may-vr1/">motorcycle emergency services</a> much go through a switchboard first. Could SMS alerts result in little more than the ineffectual actions of relatives and friends, who are presumably not trained in emergency response scenarios? Or worse, could they lead to vigilante justice scenarios rather than direct engagement with emergency professionals?

It's easy to imagine the following scenario:

<em>Friend: "help help, my friend is in trouble!"</em>

<em>911 operator: "What appears to be the trouble?"</em>

<em>Friend;" I have no idea but their wearable device sent me an alert. Hurry!"</em>

Would an emergency services agency take this seriously and respond? What's the risk?
<h2>Could these wearables be used to record evidence?</h2>
At present, safety wearables lack the means to record audio or visuals. App developers had had more success. For example the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stop-frisk-watch/id583006596?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Stop and Frisk Watch App</a> was a response to unlawful "stop and frisk" searches-an incident is recorded by pushing a trigger button on the phone.

Then there's the award-winning <a href="http://eyewitnessproject.org/">eyeWitness</a> app, part of work by international humans rights activists bringing justice to those responsible for war crimes, torture or genocide in conflicts such as those in Syria, Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The app provides a means to record images and videos with the addition of a time-stamp and GPS-fixed location and further provides a safe place to store the material. The eyeWitness team then becomes an ongoing advocate for the footage, analyzing the information and working with the appropriate legal authorities to promote accountability for those who commit the worst international crimes.

Roar for Good is actually <u>an LLC and B-corp certified,</u> involved in work to decrease harassment and attacks against women. including a partnership with the <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/2712783">One Love Foundation</a> to address the underlying causes of violence against women. It's a great case of technology for good, not just for profit.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Maintool can now make any watch into a smartwatch</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the increasingly crowded market place of smart watches, a small niche of companies is offering an alternative to the standard designs by offering smart watch bands as an alternative to smartwatch faces.

One of these is Madrid- and Paris-based startup <a href="http://maintool.me/">Maintool</a>, who have created the Classi watch band, a wearable which enables users to make their regular watches “smart."

I met with co-founder and CEO Hussain Ahamed and Community Manager Jody Serrano to learn more.

"We're giving you the chance to keep your own watch but still benefit from the same functionalities as some of the best wearable technologies," Ahamed said.

The smart watch band can be attached to any watch face. It offers a range of functionalities: sensors within the watch band measure heart rate, track footsteps and calories burned (pedometer), skin and ambient temperatures, alert through discrete vibrations and communicate with apps for iOS and Android. You can navigate to your destination hands-free and send out for help with the push of a button. Classi also has a phone loss prevention feature and will vibrate strongly if you forget your phone.

Serrano notes that "Many times, people can't tell the difference between a Classi strap and a regular watch strap. We switched out the microUSB port we used in our first prototypes for a custom magnetic charger, which greatly reduced the thickness of our watch straps. The new size makes our technology even more discreet."

<img class="size-full wp-image-6960 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/29526040966_f3b49daebf_z.jpg" alt="29526040966_f3b49daebf_z" width="640" height="401" />

<h2>Enter the smart watchband</h2>

Sales of Swiss watches are on the incline with global wearable tech devices overtaking them in Q4 of 2015, according to<a href="https://www.strategyanalytics.com/strategy-analytics/news/strategy-analytics-press-releases/strategy-analytics-press-release/2016/02/18/global-smartwatch-shipments-overtake-swiss-watch-shipments-in-q4-2015#.V9ksVJN95E4"> figures released</a> by market researcher Strategy Analytics.

This marked the first time the wearable tech devices have overtaken their luxurious counterparts. Much of the credit is attributed to the Apple smartwatch. Further, a <a href="http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ch/Documents/consumer-business/ch-en-consumer-business-deloitte-swiss-watch-study-2015.pdf">2015 report</a> by Deloitte into the Swiss watch industry revealed a lack of appreciation of the challenges to the industry by smart watches with only 25% of Swiss watch executives considered smartwatches to be a competitive threat.

In response to the challenge of the economic outlook of the industry, 41% of respondents expressed pessimism with most attributing the economic challenges to weakened demand in China and Hong Kong and the strength of the Swiss franc. It suggests an industry that is in denial with Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics stating:
<blockquote>“The Swiss watch industry has been very slow to react to the development of smartwatches. The Swiss watch industry has been sticking its head in the sand and hoping smartwatches will go away."</blockquote>
However, the upward trend of smart watches has begun to decline. IDC’s second quarter <a href="http://www.idc.com/tracker/showproductinfo.jsp?prod_id=962" target="_blank">wearable sales report</a> for 2016 revealed a 27 percent decline in smart wearables and during this time Apple had a significant decline in wearable sales. Sales dropped from 3.6 million in the same quarter last year to 1.6 million this year, a 56 percent downturn. Perhaps it's time for smart watchbands to strike.

<h2>Maintaining that Swiss watch heritage</h2>

Ahamed believes that their smart watchband can actually preserve the heritage factor of the Swiss watch industry, noting that their conversations with Swiss watch makers have been positive:
<blockquote>" The CEOs and board members are acknowledging that they didn't get on board with quart [Mechanical movements are typically chosen over quartz movements for luxury watches because of the level of quality and craftsmanship]. They admit 'We’re Swiss so we’re going to be slow but we’re interested and we’re taking notice’. The beauty of Classi is that you’re not changing your industrial model. Instead you're allowing consumers to change to our strap."</blockquote>
He also contends that:
<blockquote>
"Every watch has a personality, we want people to be able to express themselves and their personal style. Smart watches don’t have a lot of personality, there’s so much more to the watch than something that just tells the time, for a lot of people it's about the design, the brand, the culture, Smart watches today destroy this. Classi has intergenerational appeal and we believe that for the first time, this is a product that our parents and grandparents will actually wear."</blockquote>

It'll be interesting to see how sales of smart watch bands fare. They could be key to bridging the gap between a very traditional industry of dedicated craftspeople and future focused technology.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With more patients seeking medical care for sleep disorders, the world is waking up to the challenge of healthy sleep, its impact on overall health and the need for a good’s night rest.

During the recent <a href="http://www.ifa-berlin.de/">IFA</a> conference here in Berlin, Philips presented the Dream Family solution designed to improve the sleep therapy experience for people with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea">obstructive sleep apnea</a> (OSA). More than 100 million people worldwide are estimated to have OSA, a serious condition that is treated with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. <a href="http://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/sleep-and-respiratory-care/dream-family">The Dream Family</a>, comprised of the DreamWear mask, DreamStation PAP device, and DreamMapper patient engagement app, is designed to engage sleep apnea patients with one of the most comfortable and effective therapies available.

The components of the Dream Family were inspired by feedback from more than 900 patients as well as insights from clinicians who treat sleep apnea. This input combined with Philips’ more than four decades of experience developing revolutionary patient-centric solutions led to the award-winning design of the Dream Family. Since their launch in October 2015, DreamWear and DreamStation have been honored for excellence in design, including recent iF Design, Red Dot, Good Design Australia, and Core77 accolades.
<blockquote>“Sleep therapy can be challenging, and our goal is to help people across the globe get a better night’s rest – whether they live with a chronic sleep condition or are struggling to achieve eight hours a night,” said John Frank, CEO of the Sleep and Respiratory Care unit at Philips.

“Next to nutrition and exercise, sleep is the third pillar of health and now we are looking to the future for all people who need help with improving their sleep quality. We intend to make good sleep possible <div id="GezeoY" style="width: 358px"><a href="http://achatcialisfrance24.com/">achatcialisfrance24.com/</a></div> for everyone.”</blockquote>
It's interesting that they've stuck to the design of a mask for treating sleep apnea. This year, Startup <a href="http://www.fundairing.com/#first-ever-micro-cpap">Airing</a> raised more than $1.5 million on<a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/airing-the-first-hoseless-maskless-micro-cpap-sleep-technology#/"> Indiegogo</a> for its creation of a far cheaper, mask-less, cordless, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device to treat obstructive sleep apnea, an alternative to masks which many users find uncomfortable to wear at night, to the extent that 50% of CPAP users stop using it within one year. However, they have yet to get FDA clearance, a process that can take some time.
<h2>Light therapy goes mainstream</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-6911 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/HF3520_01-RTP-global-001.jpeg" alt="hf3520_01-rtp-global-001" width="379" height="500" />

Philips also showcased two light therapy solutions designed to improve the experience of getting out of bed.

Philips' <a title="Opens in a new window" href="http://www.philips-store.com/store/catalog/light-therapy/energy-light/golite-blu-energy-light/productdetail/HF3429_60_US_SHOPPUB/US/en" target="_blank">EnergyUp Energy Lights</a> lights help combat energy dips caused by jet lag, long hours inside an office, or general fatigue. A white light mimics the natural energizing power of daylight, and is clinically proven to increase energy levels and mood<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;line-height: 20px">.</span>  There's also a blue light for people to use when traveling or at the office.

There's also <a title="Opens in a new window" href="http://www.philips-store.com/store/catalog/light-therapy/wake-up-light/wake-up-light/productdetail/HF3520_60_US_SHOPPUB/US/en" target="_blank">Wake-up Light</a>, clinically proven to provide a more energetic wake-up in the morning and reduces sleepiness after waking up. The technology allows users to simulate the sunrise and choose the preferred sound for their wake up. They aren't cheap, retailing from $159 but do also function as a radio and alarm clock.

It's good to see Philips creating products that have the benefit to improve the lives of many sleepless people, who would probably pay anything for a good night's sleep and greater energy levels.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Should the Internet of Vibrating Things be worried?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's been a bad period for Canada's Standard Innovation Corp., with the news that their popular connected "pleasure device" (aka a vibrator...now everyone settle down), We Vibe 4 Plus, is easily hackable being followed by a corresponding lawsuit.

The smart vibrator released two years ago is marketed towards couples spending time apart. It's Bluetooth- and Wi-Fi- compatible and able to be controlled remotely by either partner using a cellphone app called We-Connect. This allows users to control the toy’s intensity and vibration patterns. Other features built into the app include private text messages and video calls.

At the latest <a href="https://www.defcon.org/">DefCon</a> conference held in August in Las Vegas,  two independent hackers from New Zealand, known digitally as <a class="u-underline" href="https://twitter.com/g0ldfisk">goldfisk</a> and <a class="u-underline" href="https://twitter.com/rancidbacon">follower</a>, presented a talk titled "Hacking the Internet of Vibrating Things" that revealed that the ways  that the way the vibrator connects with its controlling app isn’t secure – making it possible to remotely seize control of the vibrator and activate it at will.

<em><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/10/13/wombat-securitys-cto-offers-security-advice-to-consumers-dl4/">That connected device already knows your mom's maiden name</a></em>

The pair also discovered that the app itself was sending the temperature of the device back to Standard Innovation every minute, and any time the intensity of the vibration changed -- in effect providing data of when and how often someone is using the vibrator.

This data is stored on corporate servers and in the terms and conditions of the device the manufacturer reserves the right to pass it on to the authorities. “What are the implications of who they’re going to give that data to,” asked goldfisk. “In their privacy policy, they say ‘we reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information if required to by law’, but what does that actually mean?”
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAKY201O0bg" width="600" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h2>A new form of sexual assault?</h2>
While some may at first find the concept amusing, the reality is that the security of a sex toy should be taken seriously. As goldfisk commented during the talk:
<blockquote>“The company that makes this vibrator, Standard Innovation: They have over 2 million people using their devices, so what’s at stake is 2 million people...A lot of people in the past have said it’s not really a serious issue, but if you come back to the fact that we’re talking about people, unwanted activation of a vibrator is potentially sexual assault.”</blockquote>
In a <a href="http://we-vibe.com/blog/our-commitment-to-customer-privacy-and-security/">statement</a> in response to the workshop, Standard Innovation shared that they have engaged external security and privacy experts to conduct a thorough review of our data practices with a view of further strengthening data protection for our customers. They admit to this data collection, too:
<blockquote>"We do collect certain limited data to help us improve our products and for diagnostic purposes. As a matter of practice, we use this data in an aggregate, non-identifiable form. Processor chip temperature is used to help us determine whether device processors are operating correctly. And vibration intensity data is used for the purposes of helping us better understand how—in the aggregate—our product features are utilized."</blockquote>
In September a Canadian woman known only as N.P in an <a href="http://Going only by her initials in the 18-page class action, N.P. says she bought herself a $130 We-Vibe from an Illinois retailer this past May. She used it several times then but never realized &quot;that We-Connect monitors and records, in real time, how they use the device,&quot; according to the Sept. 2 complaint. Standard Innovation likewise failed to mention, the complaint continues, &quot;that it transmits the collected private usage information to its servers in Canada.&quot;">18-page class action</a> lodged a civil suit against Standard Innovation. She says she bought herself a $130 We-Vibe from an Illinois retailer in May but never realized "that We-Connect monitors and records, in real time, how they use the device."

Standard Innovation likewise failed to mention "that it transmits the collected private usage information to its servers in Canada."

Standard Innovation released a<a href="http://we-vibe.com/blog/we-connect-app-and-privacy-update/"> statement</a> this week that they have updated the We-Connect app and app privacy notice. This includes an option for customers to opt-out of sharing anonymous app usage data is available in the We-Connect settings and a new plain language <a href="http://we-vibe.com/we-connect-privacy">Privacy Notice</a> outlining data collection.
<h2>A short history of long breaches</h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Lm_WQdgYOcE/ThFmOxSbkbI/AAAAAAAA0ro/tOKGz6LEDgM/s1600/image%25255B7%25255D.png" alt="[image%255B7%255D.png]" border="0" />

It's worth noting the world's first smart vibrator, <a href="https://www.vibease.com/">Vibease</a>, only came on the market in 2015. Yet it's not the first leak of sensitive data. At <a href="http://www.cebit.de/home">CeBIT</a> in Hannover earlier this year, security software firm <a class=" dd-link-external" href="http://trendmicro.com/">Trend Micro</a> revealed that it was able to successfully hijack a vibrator that connect to the internet with an on-stage reveal.

Using a PIN of 0000—the default option for most bluetooth devices—Trend Micro’s researchers were able to easily connect to the vibrator and implement its own software to take control over the device.

In 2011 developer <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/waxpancake/status/87364038417330176">Andy Baio</a> revealed that Fitbit health and activity trackers were revealing users' sexual activity stats online. The company had made users’ profiles and activity public by default, to encourage social sharing and friendly competition. As a consequence, over 200 Fitbit users’ "sex-ercise" were <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/07/05/fitbit-moves-quickly-after-users-sex-stats-exposed/#6ac15acb79e7">showing up in Google search results</a>.

Then only recently a <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/mobile-security-software/glow-pregnancy-app-exposed-women-to-privacy-threats/">Consumer Report</a> into Glow Pregnancy App revealed that private health and sexual information was easily accessible, even to those without any hacking skills. Anyone with an account could request that data of another to be shared without the sharer requiring to supply permission to do so.

This meant that "anyone — loving partner, obsessive ex-husband, or anonymous creep — could link his account to any Glow users, if he knew the woman’s email address." Other vulnerabilities would allow an attacker with rudimentary software tools to collect email addresses, change passwords, and access personal information from participants in Glow’s community forums, where people discuss their sex lives and health concerns.

It's clear that security regulations in both connected devices and personal health apps need to have greater security measures implemented that involve "opt in" consent to the sharing of information, along with penalties for unsafe devices. This needs to be combined with greater consumer education and a populace that digital devices take their security seriously in the first instance.

And maybe a really secure safe word.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There are <a href="http://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/about-dementia/facts-stats/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-prevalence/">850,000 people</a> living with dementia in the UK today, a number that will increase every year as the population ages. Through the rise of sensor based technology, aged care technologists have moved from creating reactive devices such as panic buttons  to adaptive technology devices which aid memory, monitor sleep, <a href="http://www.safewander.com/">location</a>, <a href="https://www.alarm.com/productservices/wellness.aspx">daily activities</a>, <div id="qPxSEl" style="width: 307px"><a href="http://www.cialisgeneriquefr24.com/cialis-pas-cher">cialis pas cher</a></div>  food and water intake and provide family members and carers with r<a href="https://sen.se/store/mother/">eal time with remote information</a>. The overall aim is to achieve happier, healthier and longer levels is independence for the person with dementia in their own home instead of an aged care facility. Such technology also has the means to pick up signs of deterioration which may have otherwise lead to emergencies and prevent major incidents.

A ground breaking <a href="http://www.sabp.nhs.uk/news/tihm_dementia_trial/view">IoT trial</a> <div id="SyUknNRQ4yQ04PnpmwM" style="width: 263px"><a href="https://www.levitradosageus24.com/how-long-does-levitra-last-in-your-system/">https://www.levitradosageus24.com/how-long-does-levitra-last-in-your-system/</a></div> funded by NHS England and<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk"> Innovate UK</a>, the first of its kind in the UK, is part of an NHS drive  to modernise healthcare for the benefit of older people with long term health problems. Called TIHM (Technology Integrated Health Management) for dementia, the trial will help clinicians to remotely monitor the health and wellbeing of people with dementia so they can intervene earlier to help someone avoid a crisis and unnecessary hospital stay. It is also hoped the trial will relieve pressure on carers and help people with dementia to remain independent for longer. The study is recruiting 1400 people (half with dementia of half their carers) to get involved. Half of the people with dementia will be randomly selected to receive the technological devices. The remaining half will form the control group and continue with their care as usual.

People receiving the technology will have their homes kitted out with non-invasive devices, such as sensors, apps and trackers. These will connect to each other via the ‘Internet of Things’ and work together to collect and analyse different pieces of information, that will be securely managed, about a person’s health and patterns of behaviour. The data will enable the devices to identify if there is a problem. If there is, mental health professionals will be immediately alerted and a decision taken about the action needed. This may mean a clinician is sent out to visit the person or a call is made to the carer.

Technological devices in the trial include sensors attached to objects such as fridges, kettles and beds. These can, for example, detect if someone is following normal patterns of behaviour for eating and drinking or is at risk of dehydration and whether they are unusually restless at night. The technology will not replace any existing face-to-face contact with health or social care staff.

Dr Ramin Nilforooshan, leading dementia specialist at our Trust, said: “The technology is designed to alert us to any changes in behaviour or any changes in wellbeing that could signal someone is becoming unwell or that they are in trouble. For example, they may be developing a urinary tract or lower respiratory infection. We could detect the early signs/symptoms of those infections and successfully treat them at home.
<blockquote>“We know that people with dementia do not respond well to being in hospital – and that their symptoms can worsen in this environment so it is much better if we can treat them before they need to be admitted for acute care.”</blockquote>

<strong>Usage of adaptive technology is not always easy. </strong>

<a href="http://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-015-0091-3">Research</a> published in 2015 into how adaptive technology is being used by people with dementia and their carers in their daily routines suggests that such devices are typically introduced too late into the progression of dementia, making it difficult to incorporate them into the daily need of the patient, particularly if they were not already au fait with technology such as mobile phones and alarms. There was frequently a mismatch between what carer thought people with dementia would be able to accomplish and the person’s with dementia actual capabilities in relation to learning how to use new technologies. As a result, carers could misinterpret the motives of the person with dementia as they struggled with well-meaning attempts to introduce new technologies, for example:
<blockquote>
<p id="Par45" class="Para">"I bring something down, put it on that table and she just won’t touch it. I bought all sorts to try and help her; she’s just not interested. Buy something new and she’s not interested. As I say, I used to think she was just being bloody lazy, but that’s been explained to me that’s not the case. (Carer; C107)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Para">In practice, carers often had to support a person to use often even simple technologies, for example routinely telling them to look at a clock instead of simply giving them the time, or reassuring a person whenever tele-care alarms were triggered. This ‘background’ work also had to be continual. While appearing to be simple to use, many devices required a number of tasks to be completed in order to function; for example, ensuring a device was charged, or putting it in the same place each day.</p>
<p class="Para">It's easy to see the benefits of assistive technology, particularly in regard to remote settings but for it to be really usually, it needs to be understood and adopted by the person with dementia and their carer. Otherwise it is little more than a good idea. Hopefully this trial will offer some insights into the meaningful engagement of people with dementia with adaptive technology and how its efficacy can be increased.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.thyssenkrupp.com/en/">ThyssenKrupp</a> recently launched its use of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us">Microsoft HoloLens</a> technology in its elevator service operations worldwide. Currently, the global elevator service industry is valued at over $44 billion per year and more than 12 million elevators transport over 1 billion people each day.

The special mixed reality device is set to empower more than 24,000 of the company's service technicians to do their jobs more safely and efficiently, and keep people and cities moving better than ever before.

Microsoft HoloLens is the first fully self-contained wearable holographic computer running Windows 10. It is completely self-contained–no wires, phones, or connection to a PC needed. Microsoft HoloLens allows you to place holograms in your physical environment and provides a new way to see the world.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aThCr0PsyuA" width="600" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
Using HoloLens, service technicians will be able to visualize and identify problems with elevators ahead of a job, and have remote, hands-free access to technical and expert information when onsite - all resulting in significant savings in time and stress. Initial field trials have already shown that a service maintenance intervention can be done up to four times faster.

This solution follows the successful launch of <a href="https://max.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com/en/">MAX</a>, the industry’s first predictive maintenance solution which is already connected with thousands of elevators. MAX collects and sends real-time data from connected elevators to the intelligent cloud.

Intricate algorithms calculate the remaining lifetime of each elevator’s key components and systems, determining which parts will require maintenance and when. Through the use of MAX, global service engineers and technicians receive real-time alerts for pre-issue repairs, enabling them to be more proactive with customers. This includes scheduling maintenance tasks ahead of elevator breakdowns and at times of minimal disruption within the building. In this way, engineers help building managers and users avoid the frustration and inconvenience of out-of-service elevators.

Sam George, Partner Director at Microsoft's Azure IoT, added:
<blockquote>“The successful launch of IoT-enabled MAX was the first step in ThyssenKrupp’s journey to not only transform their business but also its 100-year-old industry. Predictive maintenance, powered by Microsoft Azure IoT, enabled thyssenkrupp to offer time savings to worldwide elevator passengers equivalent to 95 million hours of new availability per year of operation. Today, we are proud to have once again collaborated with thyssenkrupp to bring another game-changing solution to market together.”</blockquote>
Iconic buildings whose elevators are already cloud-connected through MAX include the One World Trade Center. The building has elevators that travel faster than Usain Bolt, capable of moving from the ground floor to the 102nd floor in just 60 seconds, and regenerative drives that convert energy produced when elevators decelerate into electricity that can be used to significantly reduce the building’s energy consumption. Now equipped with MAX and HoloLens, the tower is setting new standards for sustainability and building efficiency.

Andreas Schierenbeck, CEO of ThyssenKrupp Elevator, said:
<blockquote>"With elevators transporting over one billion people each day, the service industry has a critical role to play in keeping cities moving. We remain focused on leading the transformation in this industry; introducing the latest technologies, processes and training to enable technicians to do a better job with less stress and more fun. Our goal is to increase efficiency, raise elevator up times and speed up service interventions to ensure mobility equipment is always running as it should, providing each passenger with the safest and most comfortable travel experience possible."</blockquote>
<a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2016/microsoft-marketing-chief-hololens-totally-underestimated-commercial-interest/"><em>GeekWire</em> reports</a> that enterprise interest for HoloLens turned out to be a bit of a surprise, according to Chris Capossela, Microsoft chief marketing officer:
<blockquote>"We totally underestimated the commercial interest in this thing," Capossela said. "The team who built it, a lot of them had their roots in Xbox. Alex Kipman and Kudo [Tsunoda]. And so they originally envisioned it as something more along those lines, but as we started to show it to people, we were blown away by the commercial interest."</blockquote>
Indeed, the commercial applications for HoloLens are seemingly endless are are limited only by how fast companies can get their hands on the device. This is set to change industries such as construction, manufacturing and design.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Robots have become commonplace in many aspects of life including <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/04/24/robots-replacing-humans-in-customer-care-pr1/">health care</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/06/drones-playbook-white-house-nsc-obama-clinton-trump">military</a> and <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/09/02/robots-replace-us-dangerous-jobs-pl4/">security</a> work. Yet until recently little thought has been given outside of academic circles to the ethics of robots.

<a href="https://svrobo.org/">Silicon Valley Robotics</a> recently launched a Good Robot Design Council -- which has launched “5 Laws of Robotics” guidelines for roboticists and academics -- on the ethical creation, marketing and use of robots in everyday life. The laws state:
<ul class="postList">
 	<li id="1fac" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Robots should not be designed as weapons.</li>
 	<li id="a481" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Robots should comply with existing law, including privacy.</li>

<p id="a5d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The laws have been adapted from the EPSRC 2010 <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/ourportfolio/themes/engineering/activities/principlesofrobotics/" rel="nofollow">“Principles of Robotics”</a>. In Britain a few months ago we saw a similar document, "<a href="http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030320089">BS8611 Robots and robotic devices</a>" by the British Standards Institute (BSI) presented at the  <a href="http://socialroboticsai.com/"><em>Social Robotics and AI</em> conference</a> in Oxford as an approach to embedding ethical risk assessment in robots. It was written by a committee of scientists, academics, ethicists, philosophers and users and intended for use by robot and robotics device designers and managers to help people identify and avoid areas of potential ethical harm. Like the US laws, it contains sentiments underpinned by Isaac Asimov's <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/~vestmon/robotics.html">'Three Laws of Robotics,"</a> and it asserts:</p>
“Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans" and also that“humans, not robots, are the responsible agents; it should be possible to find out who is responsible for any robot and its behavior.”

Dan Palmer Head of Manufacturing at BSI <a href="http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2016/april/-Standard--highlighting-the-ethical-hazards-of-robots-is-published/#.V-e4_ZN95E4">said</a>:
<blockquote>“Using robots and automation techniques to make processes more efficient, flexible and adaptable is an essential part of manufacturing growth. For this to be acceptable, it is essential tha t ethical issues and hazards such as dehumanization of humans or over-dependence on robots, are identified and addressed. This new guidance on how to deal with various robot applications will help designers and users of robots and autonomous systems to establish this new area of work.”

Whilst the standard builds on existing safety requirements for different types of robots, covering industrial, personal care and medical, it also recognizes  that there are potential ethical hazards from the integration of robots and autonomous systems in everyday life, particularly when robots are in a care or companionship role such as with <a href="https://attain.news/story/8767">children</a> or the<a href="http://www.parorobots.com/index.asp"> elderly</a>.
<h2>Robot design and emotional connections</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-7743 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture-1-640.jpg" alt="picture-1-640" width="640" height="400" />

For a while, you could buy costumes for iRobot <a href="http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/entrepreneurial-kids-at-myroombud-expand-roomba-roombud-costume-line-and-distribution-for-2006-10521.php">Roomba</a> vacuum cleaners. The <a href="http://www.parorobots.com/index.asp">PARO Therapeutic Robot</a> is used in nursing homes around the world as a companion for the elderly with great success. But what happens when the relationship ends? One need only look at the grieving that occurred when Sony's AIBO robotic dog  -- released in 1999 -- was discontinued in 2006 with the announcement repairs and spare parts would be discontinued in 2014. For many owners, it was like watching a pet slowly die. There were even <a href="https://www.dramafever.com/news/dead-robot-dogs-can-now-get-a-proper-buddhist-funeral/%7B%5B%7Bnotification.object.url%7D%5D%7D">Buddhist funerals</a> available for AIBO dogs in Japan. The reality is, when people are associating robots with pets or humans, they are attaching  an emotional connection to them.

<h2>Robots for love and maybe more?</h2>
The idea of robot lovers is not a far-fetched as it might sound. Films such as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/">Her</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Ex Machina</a> and the television series <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4122068/">Humans </a>present a future where humans fall in love and/or want to have physical relationships with AI and robots. However, there are currently no widely available sex robots in creation. The closest correlation seems to be incredibly lifelike sex dolls including extremely disturbing ones featuring <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/japan-trottla-dolls-lifesize-lingerie">children</a>).

Sex business entrepreneur Bradley Charvet <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/10/01/sex-robot-cafe-open-london/">has revealed his plans to open a sex robot café in London</a>, where visitors will be able to receive “cyber-fellatio” while drinking tea. “Sex with a robot will always be pleasing and they could even become better at techniques because they would be programmable to a person’s need. It’s totally normal to see a new way of using robots and others sex toys to have pleasure.”

The issue of robots and human attachments at such a level causes discomfort to many. The second annual <em><a href="http://loveandsexwithrobots.org/">Love and Sex with Robots</a> </em>academic conference was supposed to be held in Malaysia in November 2015. But in October, the Inspector-General of Police <a href="http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/10/13/igp-declares-sex-with-robots-conference-illegal/">declared the conference illegal</a>, highlighting the country's conservative morals and likening robots to deviant culture, and it had to be canceled abruptly. The next conference is in London in December. There's even an organization "<a href="https://campaignagainstsexrobots.org/">Campaign against sex robots</a>" that predicts their existence is not that far away. They believe that:
<blockquote>"The development of sex robots will further reduce human empathy that can only be developed by an experience of mutual relationship. We challenge the view that the development of adult and child sex robots will have a positive benefit to society, but instead further reinforce power relations of inequality and violence."</blockquote>
Even forensic <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2099607-could-sex-robots-and-virtual-reality-treat-paedophilia/">researchers into the treatment</a> of sexual deviance claim that:
<blockquote>“It’s very important to understand this because we need to do more to prevent child sexual abuse and exploitation. And it’s only a matter of time before dolls are souped up with artificial intelligence. How lifelike can they get? Will more realistic technologies help reduce the problem, or make it worse? We need to start figuring out what the impact will be. The cost if we don’t explore it is intolerably high.”</blockquote>
<h2>What about robots and physical violence?</h2>
&nbsp;

<img class="size-full wp-image-7747 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/LA_County_Sheriff_Bomb_Robot_2.jpg" alt="la_county_sheriff_bomb_robot_2" width="512" height="340" />

While robots aren't sentient androids (yet), it's worth remembering that robots<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em><span style="font-family: Georgia">are</span></em><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>currently committing acts of violence. Drones, essentially flying robots, are utilized to strike in<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="https://dronewars.net/drones-and-targeted-killing/">armed, unmanned combat</a> in civilian and war zones. Then in the US we've recently seen a scenario where a<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/07/12/killing-dallas-shooter-robot-right-choice-dt1/">robot was used to detonate a bomb</a><span class="apple-converted-space">in response to a police killing, ultimately leading to the death of Micah Johnson who killed five police officers and wounded seven others in Dallas. This action sets a new precedent in how these robotic devices are being used at home. As Ryan Matthew Pierson writes:</span>
<blockquote>"This is the first known case of a United States police department using a remotely positioned explosive to kill a suspect. Where gunfire and other means of lethal force are unfortunately common practice by police in the United States, using a robot to administer that force is new."</blockquote>
If military and police are excluded from the "do no harm" pledges of the Good Robot Design Council and BSI, what kind of precedent is established? What role does defense play in robot ethics with the creation of robots designed to kill during police or military operations? Will ethics be able to keep up with the technological advances and indeed growing uses of robots?  Only time will tell.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the last 20 years, technologists have been working hard to create solutions to the challenges of gun safety. Their efforts have kept pace with the technological developments of Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, sensor technology, wearables and IoT.

Yet their implementation has been slow, if not stalled to a halt. I wanted to look at the pain points in this trajectory and how and when it could move forward. I also spoke to one person who believes the blockchain could solve some of the back-end structural challenge: Kevin Barnes, founder of the <a href="https://www.blocksafefoundation.com/">Blocksafe Foundation</a>, who is also a 20-year US Army veteran as well as architect and coder.

<em><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/09/24/blockchain-drives-wanxiangs-30b-smart-city-project-cl4/">Blockchain drives $30B Wanxiang's $30B smart city project</a></em>

But first, let's delve into guns before we explore the inclusion of the blockchain. In April  this year, President Obama<a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/obama-orders-feds-to-study-smart-gun-technology/" target="_blank"> made funding for smart gun research</a> part of his end-of-term efforts.  The smart gun promises a technological fix for gun violence by keeping firearms out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them — thieves, children, and anyone else who isn’t the authorized user.

A smart gun is a firearm that includes a safety feature or features that allow it to fire only when activated by an authorized user. These safety features can prevent misuse, accidental shootings, gun thefts, use of the weapon against the owner, and self-harm. Smart guns distinguish between authorized users and unauthorized users in several different ways, including the use of RFID chips or other proximity tokens, fingerprint recognition, wearable devices, or mechanical locks.
<h2>The strange history of smart guns</h2>
For those of us born outside of America, it's hard to imagine the notion that smart gun development has been thwarted by politics and <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-is-the-u-s-ready-for-smart-guns/">political lobbying</a> and an underlying concern that their introduction would lead to stricter gun control. But it's the strange reality. In 1999, gunmaker Smith &amp; Wesson promised the Clinton White House to develop smart guns that can be fired only by the adults who own them as part of a deal to fend off liability litigation.

The gun lobby organized a boycott against Smith &amp; Wesson, perceiving smart guns and other concessions in the deal as part of the gun control agenda. Factories closed, employees were laid off, and  for some time, big U.S. gunmakers avoided smart guns. The boycott stemmed from fear that smart guns would soon be the only guns people were allowed to buy, infringing on individual’s rights bear arms of their choosing.

Gunmakers Colt received a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://fortune.com/2015/04/22/smart-guns-theyre-ready-are-we/" target="_blank">$500,000 grant</a> from the Justice Department in 1997 to complete development of a handgun that would work with RFID via a wristband. Smith and Wesson <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://oig.justice.gov/grants/g7005012.htm" target="_blank">received</a> more than $3 million in Justice Department  grants between 2000 and 2004 to develop smart guns for law enforcement. The prototypes were completed but no one was using them and Smith &amp; Wesson had to layoff 15 percent of its staff due to boycotts.

In 2014, when <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-maryland-smartgun-idUSBREA410SD20140502">Engage Armament</a> of Washington shared their intentions to sell the <a href="http://www.armatix.de/iP1-Pistol.779.0.html?&amp;L=1">German Armatix iP1 .22</a>-caliber handgun, which electronically limits the ability to fire the weapon, the shop received thousands of complaints and threats of violence and death, forcing them to reconsider their decision.

The Armatix gun is implanted with an electronic chip that allows it to be fired only if the shooter is wearing a watch that communicates with it through a radio signal. If the gun is moved more than ten inches from the watch, it will not fire.

In New Jersey, lawmakers passed a 2002 law requiring that guns be “smart” once they have been available on the market for three years. That three-year countdown has never been started in part because of pressure from gun rights activists on manufacturers not to develop the technology.

<a href="http://www.guns.com/2016/09/22/smart-gun-bill-introduced-in-congress/">This week</a> California congressman Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, submitted the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr6080" target="_blank">Modernizing Firearms Technology Act </a>to Congress. The bill would require gun retailers to display at least one personalized firearm and make it available for buyers who are not prohibited by law from possessing a handgun. If licensees don’t, they would incur a $1,000 annual fine.
<h2>Solving gun safety challenges with the blockchain</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-7669 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/blocksafe-stolen-locked-flow-chart.png" alt="blocksafe-stolen-locked-flow-chart" width="800" height="450" />

“Law enforcement use has been limited because of a lack of proper infrastructure for adequate adoption of smart gun tech,” Barnes said. “They have video recording and some try to use sound sensors to listen for firearm discharge in the city. But without a non-hackable decentralized infrastructure, IoT devices like smart devices on guns have too many security risks. Blocksafe is aiming to solve this major hurdle.”

A blockchain-based system provides the ability to enable, disable, track and secure firearms without any centralized control or reporting according to Barnes. Blocksafe is primarily a software-based project, providing the infrastructure to support the smart-device hardware that manufacturers and 3D print projects use to enhance the safety and defense capabilities of firearms. It's a peer to peer network that uses a combination of lisk,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>BitTorrent and Telehash.

In basic terms, when a gun fires, the Blocksafe “shotspot” technology senses and logs details on the Blocksafe ledger. Notifications simultaneously go to emergency personnel. Multiple “shotspots” work together to detect, locate and respond to gun discharges.
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When setting up a smart device initially, Bluetooth authentication is setup via the Blocksafe app by the owner and all authorized users are added by the device owner and stored on the local ledger. Authentication method could vary upon the device and manufacturer. A gun's </span><span class="s1">round count and authentication attempt parameters are stored in real time along with other data that the device owner chooses to be recorded such as date, time, and location using encryption onto the local ledger of the device. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When the device has internet access the ledger is synced to the network and the device owner receives notifications such as push, sms, or email as configured by the owner’s chosen device settings. The data is encrypted via a data key on the network. So, only those who have the data kept from the device owner will be able to view the actual device activity.</span></p>
<p class="p1">“The network’s purpose is to support the smart device’s features on the network such as logging activity and remote management that only the device owner can do,” Barnes explained. “For example, a smart lock can be used on the gun and can alert the owner of unauthorized discharges using the Blocksafe app. This will help the device owner control the use and location of the firearm.”</p>

<h2>How to lock and not load</h2>
The technology will include locks that mount on the gun. Barnes said they are developing custom prototypes of smart devices, but their bigger focus is on developing and maintaining the Blocksafe network and infrastructure. Blocksafe will provide SDK, API and support for other manufacturers to use the Blocksafe network.

“The stakes are too high for a hackable, controllable third-party solution,” Barnes said. “We believe that an anonymous, secure and decentralized infrastructure must be in place to reduce gang activity, locate stolen firearms, and prevent guns from being used against owners. These advanced features can save lives and our right of self-defense.

At time of interview, Barnes was in discussion with the <a href="https://smarttechfoundation.org/">Smart Tech Foundation </a> to look at collaborative opportunities. Whilst it seems unlikely that smart guns will ever replace traditional guns outright unless the legislature can be stronger than the lobbyists, the reality is that they could significantly advance gun safety into the future.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[E-commerce is challenging the retail environment in many ways from <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/05/17/how-iot-is-changing-the-fashion-retail-experience-vr4/">fitting rooms</a> to <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/06/06/the-internet-of-commerce-is-coming-pr1/">customer relations</a>. Then there's the challenges before products even hit the store, as warehouses full of goods struggle are faced with the challenge of finding staff to find, pack and deliver orders.

The top three challenges facing supply chain executives, as identified by a <a href="http://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/deloitte-mhi-annual-report.html">Deloitte and MHI survey</a>, are hiring and retaining a skilled workforce (58 percent), meeting customer demand for fast response times (56 percent) and lowering delivery costs (56 percent).

Robots’ potential to improve productivity offers a solution for all of those challenges by working alongside human workers to pick and ship more products faster for less cost per pick.

One company that's changing this is <a href="http://www.inviarobotics.com/">inVia Robotics</a>. They've developed the world’s first “goods-to-box” robotics system, which was created to transform the fulfillment and material handling operations of e-commerce providers and warehouses. I spoke to CEO of inVia Robotics CEO Lior Elazary to learn more.  He explained:
<blockquote>“E-commerce is booming, but retailers are struggling to keep up with consumer demand, due to rising price pressures, increasing expectations for faster delivery and a shortage of warehouse labor. For decades, the man-to-goods model reigned supreme, but now with robots in the warehouse, goods can autonomously navigate across warehouses to be sent to their final destinations quickly and cheaply. Robotics is the next evolution of automation and unlocking its benefits will enable more businesses to stay competitive, which will positively impact the industry and economy.”</blockquote>
inVia have produced two robots. The GrabIt robot can lift items up to 30 pounds and up to 24 inches wide, ranging in size from a deck of cards to a 24-pack of soda. It can also reach up to eight feet and work for 10 hours on a single battery charge. Once a product is picked, a GrabIt robot can offload an item to its companion -- inVia's second robot, the TransIt -- which can accumulate orders and zip them to an awaiting box to be shipped.

Included with the robots is a robotics management system that enables their customers to dynamically change their workflow in real time as well as minimize wait times, empowering businesses to change their processes on-the-fly.

<img class="wp-image-7925 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/unnamed-1024x576.jpg" alt="unnamed" width="713" height="401" />

What is significant is that inVia have been able to respond to some of the challenges experienced by other workplace robotics operations. Elazary said:
<blockquote>"What’s really allowed us to do this is we’re not just a robotic arm on top of a device. The grip design really enables the device to really grab an array of things. That said, there's still about 20% of the items in a typical warehouse that robots can’t pick like little screws and tiny cables so in those instances a worker can be notified to bring those items to the packing station. We've also created a system that is able to take single items- most customers really only had 1-3 products per item per order e.g. a shirt and a hammer rather than multiples. The other challenge was developing  a cost effective platform so that it was financially viable for warehouses to acquire robots. Advancements in AI and vision sensors have enabled us to utilise a very cost effective platform  and has enabled us to scale and grow very quickly."</blockquote>
<div>

This also benefits the warehouse. "We’ve created a flexible system that puts you in more control of your warehouse. Start with one robot. Start with 10. Add robots, or pull back, based on seasonal demand," Elazary said.

The company’s solution is available through a Robotics as a Service business model (RaaS)  that requires a minimal upfront investment, enabling more businesses to take advantage of robotics’ productivity gains. Customers pay monthly for each robot, which allows them to quickly scale up or down to meet seasonal or fluctuating demand. Perhaps one of inVia's biggest points of difference is that their system can basically be employed in any factory without the need to redesign the physical environment by including different shelving or more assembly lines.  As Elazary shared:

"We wanted operations to be up and running very quickly so people don’t have to change their warehouses and redo everything. Historically most robotics companies will only work on completely empty warehouses. We can take the existing shelving and the flow that you have and just modify the directions of where things are flowing instead of  building a system that you have to invest millions of dollars in infrastructure to accommodate the robots. An additional benefit is that the rest of the operations are not disadvantaged if one robot is out of action as is the case if a assembly line was installed for the robots to use."

<img class="size-full wp-image-7928 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Amazon-warehouse.jpg" alt="amazon-warehouse" width="600" height="400" />
<h2>But are robotics taking human jobs?</h2>
I queried whether in this instance, robots were taking jobs from under or unemployed people. Elazary explained that in his discussions with a diverse number of warehouses, they actually experience significant labor shortages  both in peak and long term periods. For example, their customer <a href="http://www.ldproducts.com/">LD Products</a>, one of the largest printer and office supplies companies, has automated what used to be manual processes and helped it overcome labor shortages and seasonality while scaling as its business grows.

The warehouse environment is a challenging one for many, particularly as warehouses are often in remote locations where no one wants to live much less travel to. The converse is that robotics can actually make the lives of warehouse employees better. I'm sure I'm not the only person who read <a href="http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/life-and-death-amazon-temp/">"The Life and Death of an Amazon Warehouse Temp"</a> a few years ago with a sense of horror and sadness.

Elazary explained that where their robotics had been deployed  "workers give really good feedback because now they don’t have to do that job. Often people think of a warehouse as having a lot of people there but they usually don’t, it's a very, very tight margin, usually very short staffed. Also being a picker is a grueling, physically demanding job. Some companies actually have raffles at the beginning of the day to make sure employees come in that day."

There's a lot of application for inVia's system in other industries including agriculture, customer manufacturing and the general retail warehouse at supermarkets and department stores where the use of robots could "put the employees where they are supposed to be which is customer facing and really driving sales instead just doing the grunt labour or picking out the shoes, that can be done by the robot."

inVia has created an impressive product, which may indeed bring about warehouse labor as we know it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tech giants Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Google’s DeepMind, Facebook have joined forces to create a non-profit alliance called <a href="http://Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society">Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society</a> that will work to advance public understanding of artificial intelligence technologies (AI) and formulate best practices on the challenges and opportunities within the field.

Academics, non-profits, and specialists in policy and ethics will be invited to join the Board of the organization.

The objective of the partnership is to address opportunities and challenges with AI technologies to benefit people and society. Together, the organization’s members will conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open license in <div id="6XEv01vNzKWnHa" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://cialisfrance24.com/">fr</a></div> areas such as ethics, fairness, and inclusivity; transparency, privacy, and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability, and robustness of the technology.

The organization’s founding members will each contribute financial and research resources to the partnership and will share leadership with independent third-parties, including academics, user group advocates, and industry domain experts. There will be equal representation of corporate and non-corporate members on the board of this new organization.

Eric Horvitz, Technical Fellow &amp; Managing Director, Microsoft Research said:
<blockquote>“We’re excited about this historic collaboration on AI and its influences on people and society. We see great value ahead with harnessing AI advances in numerous areas, including health, education, transportation, public welfare, and personal empowerment. We’re extremely pleased with how early discussions among colleagues blossomed into a promising long-term collaboration. Beyond folks in industry, we’re thrilled to have other stakeholders at the table, including colleagues in ethics, law, policy, and the public at large. We look forward to working arm-in-arm on best practices and on such important topics as ethics, privacy, transparency, bias, inclusiveness, and safety.”</blockquote>

<h2>Who's in...and who's out</h2>
Interestingly it does <div id="GBFRuzve7jWodx" style="width: 217px"><a href="http://www.cialisgeneriquefr24.com/">cialisgeneriquefr24.com</a></div> not intend to lobby government or other policymaking bodies, yet members will presumably include legal professionals. After all, it's likely that there will be significant challenges to the rule of law, at least in the developed world, as AI advances into all echelons of society and policy in a broad range of areas from health care to military analytics. The law in general has traditionally struggled to maintain pace with the rapid advancements of technological innovation.

Notably absent are Apple and <a href="https://openai.com/about/">Open AI</a>, the non-profit research think tank created by Elon Musk in 2015, though it's possible they will be late additions. It's foreseeable that as AI develops as the next industrial revolution, preceded by IoT, that a number of watchdog organizations will develop to respond to the challenges of AI particularly in regard to changes to the workforce in some sectors and the social challenges like robotic ethics. The next few years will be a time of fascinating research and discussions for all.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The use of drones is evolving from their role in military strikes to support, commercial and recreational roles around the world. These include the use of drones as first responders in Denmark for <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dji-and-eena-partner-to-promote-first-response-missions-300247747.html">firefighting, chemical accidents and larger car accidents</a> in urban and over-water environments, shark harvesting in Australia, delivering medical aid in Rwanda and in tests by German lifeguards for <a href="http://dronelife.com/2016/08/12/german-drone-company-demonstrates-lifeguard-drone/">sea rescue drowning scenarios</a>.

Then there's the intended <a href="https://www.hyl.io/">drone delivery services</a> planned by online retailers such as <a href="http://dronelife.com/2016/08/12/german-drone-company-demonstrates-lifeguard-drone/">Amazon</a> and the bizarre stunt to <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/09/22/behind-scenes-jerky-bot-dl1/">deliver beef jerky by drone</a>. Not to mention that almost every start-up tech conference will have a low flying drone or two observing the action.

It would be fair to say that the potential applications of drones in our daily lives are only limited by our imagination. But as the commercial application of drones expands on an almost daily basis we can see evidence of a legal and regulatory minefield that is struggling to keep up with the evolution of drone technology

<img class="wp-image-8956 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/prime-air_02-1024x528.jpg" alt="prime-air_02" width="787" height="406" />
<h2>Setting laws for hobby and commercial drones</h2>
The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) <a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=20515">published new regulations</a> in August pertaining to the commercial use of drones. Previously commercial drone operators needed to have a sports pilots license or higher. Now, all you have to do is pass a new aeronautical exam. Under the new rules, operators can't fly drones higher than 400 feet or at night. The drones must also weigh under 55 pounds and must remain in the visual sight of a human operator — something that prohibits any kind of long-distance drone use, including even the most basic delivery drones. Commercial drones will also only be allowed to operate during daylight hours or civil twilight. Also disallowed are any operations from a moving vehicle — unless you are in a “sparsely populated area.”

<a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/fly_for_fun/">Hobbyist and recreational drone users</a> are required to register their drone with the FAA (a mere $5 for 3 years) and adhere to some fairly common sense rules consistent with that of commercial drones like remaining in site of the drone, avoiding aircraft, sports stadiums and emergency response scenarios and not flying under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
<h2>A technology ripe for insurance claims</h2>
However as the use of drones expands, so does the need for insurance. I recently spoke with Sentil Rajamanickam, FSI Strategy &amp; Operations Manager at data analytics company <a href="http://www.infogix.com/">InfoGix</a> about the challenges of underwriting drone insurance. He explained:
<blockquote>"Today, <span class="il">drone</span> insurance underwriting is based on a geospatial map used to determine the likelihood that a <span class="il">drone</span> will have a safe flight. Simply basing underwriting on geospatial mapping can wrongfully calculate the risk of an accident. What if unexpected weather hits or a temporary structure (e.g. construction equipment) gets in the way that isn’t picked up by the mapping?</blockquote>
<blockquote>One inherent flaw we’ve observed with non-traditional insurance, like <span class="il">drone</span> insurance, is that it tends to be driven by past data. Past data doesn’t always accurately predict the future and when something unpredictable happens there is a higher probability of very large losses."</blockquote>
One way to offset such unpredictable, complex risk underwriting is to leverage risk models that are based on the statistical data across a particular region or country and that constantly correlate risk events with pricing. The challenge for underwriters is that they are limited by the data available for such complex underwriting analysis due to non-scalable management information systems or core systems that cannot support complex data requirements.

The somewhat contradictory situation is that drone insurance metrics can be improved by increased drone flights, where drone users fly drones which record flight paths, height, speed, aerial mapping etc. and can be used as a leverage for the price point of insurance or as a precedent of good 'flying' history in the case of future litigation.
<h2>Are hobbyists just waiting to get sued?</h2>
Rajamanickam cautions that many recreational users may not be aware of the regulations such as the need to register and weight and aerial height regulations and note that "as recreational users are slowly increasing there's a real need to educate them." Retailer Best Buy, has posted <a href="http://www.modelaircraft.org/gov/docs/safetyinsert-bestbuy.pdf" target="_blank">safety brochures</a> in more than 1,000 stores and Amazon posts links to the <a href="http://knowbeforeyoufly.org/">Know before you fly</a> website in its retail section. But it's easy to imagine scenarios where an errant drone user operates the drone upon receipt on their birthday morning only to cause havoc with a neighbour's garden, pets, windows or small children.  Could a s<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGCJiS3mCak">cary scenario</a>, during Halloween this year result in a lawsuit of emotional distrust? Maybe add a clown or two.

Then of  course, there's the potential for breaches of privacy just waiting for those who operate drones with filming capabilities.  In terms of privacy protection on a national level, there are the <a href="https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/voluntary_best_practices_for_uas_privacy_transparency_and_accountability_0.pdf" target="_blank">Voluntary Best Practice Guidelines </a>issued by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).

They essentially warn drone operators to give notice before flying, to secure data that is collected and don’t share it and comply with state and local laws. Note that these are as of yet, only voluntary guidelines.  Yet this could potentially be the biggest catalyst for potential lawsuits, particularly against commercial drone companies who undertake aerial surveillance and filming.

The reality is that the insurance needed by drone operators will evolve as our range of drones and use expands. If you're planning on buying a drone as a gift for a loved one this Christmas, adding an insurance policy might not be a bad idea.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.ibeat.com/">iBeat's</a> Heart Alert &amp; Emergency Watch is a sleek and comfortable watch you wear 24/7. The device's medical grade sensors constantly monitor your heart activity and detect for emergencies. In an emergency, iBeat will alert you, your loved ones and 911, sending immediate care and potentially saving your life.

consider panic alarms (typically worn obtrusively around the neck on a lanyard) as dehumanising

Partner Dr. Mehmet Oz from <a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/">Dr Oz show </a>

By perpetually monitoring for oncoming life-threatening heart incidents such as cardiac arrest (a sudden, sometimes temporary, cessation of heart function) or atrial fibrillation (an irregular, often rapid heart rate that can cause poor blood flow and lead to stroke), the iBeat Heart Alert &amp; Emergency Watch ensures you receive immediate care in the event of a life-threatening emergency.

According to creators, when it does detect a problem, the watch sounds an alarm asking if the user is “OK”. If there’s no response or if the user does push the “No” button, the watch will dial emergency services and any family members programmed into the device. All this can also be activated by the user holding down an emergency call button on the watch for at least two seconds.

Since it has its own cellular connectivity built in, it doesn’t need a smartphone to operate. Moreover, because there’s a GPS inside as well, it will provide the user’s location to emergency responders and family members to help speed up the response. The responders and caretakers receive a text message with a map of the user’s location, even if the patient is moving. This lets the medical team respond in an appropriate way, whether by sending out an ambulance or warning an emergency room to get ready for a new arrival, while family members are always aware of the person’s location and can come quickly to the receiving hospital.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/7000655/Builder-life-saved-by-Apple-Watch.html">saved by his Apple Watch</a>. Dennis Anselmo, a 62-year-old builder, felt “terrible” after taking lunch. Anselmo had a rest, and during that time looked at his Apple Watch, checking his pulse. He discovered that it was well over twice what it should be, registering 210 beats per minute.

Anselmo then called for an ambulance, and at hospital was later told that had he gone home he may well have died. Instead the doctors were able to clear his arterial blockage and he’s now doing well. And Anselmo isn’t the first person to claim that their Apple Watch has saved their life either.

<strong>Predictive wearables are the future</strong>

<img class="size-full wp-image-8253 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/HealthPatch-MD.jpg" alt="healthpatch-md" width="600" height="349" />

Predictive wearables are the future is the growth in their creation is anything to go by.

&nbsp;

VitalConnect has developed  a adhesive <a href="http://www.vitalconnect.com/healthpatch-md">health patch</a> of biosensors to continuously track comprehensive vital signs and biometrics wherever the patient is and transmit the data to the patient's healthcare provider, providing the ability to observe improvement or degradation on a real-time basis and intervene if necessary.The capabilities measured include Single lead ECG, heart and respiratory rates, skin temperature, fall detection and activity including steps.

The sensor itself is reusable, while a disposable patch, which comes with a choice of three adhesives, is used to stick it onto the chest.
The sensor, which has a battery life between 48 and 72 hours, can share its readings with another device via Bluetooth 4.0.

For asthmatics, a Health and Environmental Tracker (HET) created at North Carolina State University is in the works incorporating a host of sensing devices , which are incorporated into a wristband and a patch that adheres to the chest.The patch includes sensors that track a patient’s movement, heart rate, respiratory rate, the amount of oxygen in the blood, skin impedance and wheezing in the lungs. The wristband focuses largely on environmental factors, monitoring volatile organic compounds and ozone in the air, as well as ambient humidity and temperature. The wristband also includes additional sensors to monitor motion, heart rate and the amount of oxygen in the blood. The system also has one non-wearable component: a spirometer, which patients breathe into several times a day to measure lung function.Whilst it's efficacy sounds promising it'S questionable how many people with asthma would comply with this somewhat onerous regime.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://cusp.nyu.edu/">Centre for Urban Science and Progress</a> at New York University has recently released the findings from a smart city <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1609/1609.08780.pdf">pilot study</a>. It's the first in-depth analysis of a local New York Neighborhood intent on measuring the quantified community. They utilized IoT sensors to collect and analyze quality-of-life measurements at high spatial and temporal resolution in the neighborhood of Red Hook, Brooklyn.

Red Hook is an economically disadvantaged neighborhood. There is no subway service, only a few Internet hot spots and close to 70 percent of the population lives in New York City housing projects. Residents experience an asthma rate of more than 2.5 times that of the national average and more than a third live below the federal poverty line. The life expectancy of residents in Red Hook is 10 years lower than the national average. Red Hill was significantly affected by flooding caused by <a href="http://portsidenewyork.org/portsidetanke/2013/02/red-hook-sandy-surge-map.html">Hurricane Sandy</a> in 2012.

The measurement of quantified communities is a long-term neighborhood informatics research initiative. Researchers will study three New York neighborhoods-Hudson Yards, Lower Manhattan, and Red Hook. They aim to collect, measure, and analyze data on the physical and environmental conditions and human behavior of each neighborhood to better understand how neighborhoods and the built environment affect individual and social well-being.
<h2>Between physical environment and social health</h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-8886 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/29798779013_b969262745_z.jpg" alt="29798779013_b969262745_z" width="480" height="640" />

Researchers explored the correlation between the physical, environmental, and social components of the community. Baseline community measurements focused on environmental measurements including air quality, temperature, pressure, humidity, and luminosity.

They collected air quality data, particularly PM2.5 concentrations (which have been shown to have a direct impact on cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary health) at the street level. Coupling this data with building energy use data allows them to explore how the quality of the built environment, human behavior, and environmental conditions interact to affect public health.

Researchers  explored the impact of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island">urban heat island (UHI)</a>. This is where man-made urban surfaces (such as concrete and asphalt) lead to an increased heating of the surrounding area. UHIs are linked to respiratory health conditions, high energy consumption and pollution. Localized temperature quantifications enable researchers to ascertain the connection between temperature, physical environment and resident health.  The result can assist local authorities to identify buildings and communities vulnerable to heat waves and other heat related emergencies.
<h2>Citizen science makes metrics inclusive</h2>

&nbsp;

A new urban sensing platform was developed for the project, the QC Urban QoL Sensor. This is a low-cost, but reliable sensor array using the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2000">5V Trinket Pro </a>by Adafruit Industries. The devices measure air quality, noise, light levels, pedestrian counts, and temperature/pressure/humidity.

When the sensor data is combined with administrative, mobility, social media, and Wi-Fi usage data it can create a neighborhood profile to benchmark changes over time and compare to other areas of the city. These measures are designed to help communities identify and solve problems, focusing on issues of environmental health and mobility, through new sensing modalities, analytics, and data visualization. The <a href="http://rhicenter.org/">Red Hook Initiative</a> (RHI), a local social services community organization, was enlisted to install the sensors and engage with the local community to provide additional, volunteered data.

Four sensors were installed Red Hook at different heights. Local residents were also provided with portable sensors for a short period of time to measure temperature, noise and air quality at five-second intervals. This provided an opportunity to  identify problems through data science by those that know the area best.

While IoT technologies are viewed as the next generation of urban infrastructure, low-income and economically distressed communities are often not the focus of urban and civic technology deployments, and the question of equity continues to be overshadowed by expedience in many technology-led city strategies.
<h2>Great opportunities for collaboration</h2>
The efforts of CUSP correlate well with other community projects such as <a href="http://rhicenter.org/red-hook-wifi/">Red Hook Wifi</a> which aims to bring free local Wifi to residents, <a href="https://pioneerworks.org/hack-red-hook/">Hack Red Hook</a> where participants created projects such as <a href="http://highground.nyc/">HighGround.nyc</a>, a system that manages vehicle evacuation during emergency flooding situations. There's also <a href="http://openseweratlas.tumblr.com/">Open Sewer Atlas NYC</a>, an open source mapping and data project that aims to assist in the improvement of wastewater / stormwater management by organizations with limited access to technical information and data.

In regard to whether it is possible to elicit sensor data that can be utilized to influence local community or public policy, CUSP's results have so far been somewhat underwhelming.

The biggest spike in air pollution was attributed to a local community BBQ.  But researchers have been successful in creating a community project that involved local residents. Their data is only from the first of the three neighborhoods to be compared and contrasted. It's a great opportunity to compare different neighborhoods and the impact of land use, and ultimately involve citizens in smart science within their community.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate  has announced the selection of 10 start-up companies to be part of <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/accelerator">EMERGE 2016: Wearable Technology</a>, an accelerator program designed to bring start-ups, accelerators, and other strategic partners together in a common research and development effort. The program operates in conjunction in conjunction with <a href="http://technexus.com/">TechNexus</a> and its partner <a href="http://www.cit.org/">CIT</a>.

First responders such as police, fire and emergency services  have a tremendous need for devices such as body-worn electronics, advanced sensors, and integrated voice and data communications embedded within their gear. Hands-free wearables can integrate multiple technologies and minimize additional equipment while maximizing effective response efforts.

<em><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="http://U.S. backs research into smart shirts for emergency responders">U.S. research into smart shirts for emergency responder</a></em>

“This is an important step for science and technology to tap into the innovation ecosystem,” said DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology Dr. Reginald Brothers. “We need to find technologies for first responders that can be integrated directly into their existing gear. The entrepreneurial world is on the leading edge of those inventive solutions.”

As part of the program, the 10 start-ups will have access to first responder feedback, industry partners and investors, and business development educational resources from mentors around the business world. The access and resources available will assist in early market validation efforts, test and evaluation opportunities, and the establishment of a path to introduce their technologies to a variety of markets, including government sector partners.

The selected start-ups include:

<strong><a href="http://www.haasalert.com/">HAAS Alert</a> </strong>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9176" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/HAASAlert.jpg" alt="haasalert" width="800" height="450" />

HAAS alert is a connected and autonomous V2V mobile platform that provides preemptive warning to drivers, motorcyclists and bicyclists when emergency vehicles are approaching. This is through a mobile vehicle-to-vehicle communication platform that uses acoustic sensors to pick up environmental and situational noise, and location data to connect people, vehicles, and things in cities, streamlining the disaster and emergency notification process to keep communities safe.

<strong><a href="http://www.augmate.com/">Augmate</a>: </strong>

<img class="wp-image-9145 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/new_feature_battery.png" alt="new_feature_battery" width="512" height="445" />

Augmate have developed a provisioning and management platform for wearable devices that helps IT departments track users and their devices, collect sensor data, communicate with workers, and control approved applications and situational connectivity. The platform enables a workplace to monitor each device's battery status and last location by implementing locational beacon technology. It's currently used with good success in industries such as manufacturing and mining and would have a important contribution to emergency services.

<a href="http://www.commandwear.com/"><strong>Command Wear</strong></a>

<img class=" wp-image-9181 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/10405513_508180769284461_1660634376190722737_n.jpg" alt="10405513_508180769284461_1660634376190722737_n" width="391" height="607" />

Command Wear have created a software platform that connected with first responders existing smartphones, smart watches and tablets to provide  personnel tracking, two-way text communication and video sharing to speed response, improve situational awareness and keep responders safe. Geo-fencing alerts personnel that they’re entering hazard zones or moving outside an assigned area. Teams can also review everything that happens during a for later analysis or investigation after the event.

<a href="http://www.lumenus.com/"><strong>Lumenus</strong></a>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9175" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/luminus-main.jpg" alt="luminus-main" width="970" height="560" />

Lumenus is a smart clothing company, creating smart clothing that uses LED lighting and connectivity to improve visibility of consumers and industrial workers. The company ran a Kickstarter campaign last year for two jackets, a vest and a backpack that enable wearers to be seen more easily at night  with a corresponding app  to include a GPS component to promote cyclist safety, which includes cycle-friendly directions and the ability to modify their routes to avoid hazardous locations.

<strong><a href="http://www.six-15.com/"> Six15 Technologies</a></strong>

<img class="wp-image-9183 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/1780156_781335121879856_76619775_o-1024x683.jpg" alt="1780156_781335121879856_76619775_o" width="650" height="434" />

Six15 Technologies is the at the forefront of wearable solutions for Public Safety, Security, and First Responders, creating rugged, high-resolution head mounted displays (HMD) and OEM optoelectronic modules including custom computing and display solutions. Their AR Glasses Platform is also used to good affect in industries such as mining and manufacturing.

<strong><a href="https://www.vaultexposuretracker.com/">Vault RMS</a> </strong>

<img class="size-large wp-image-9178 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-10-27-at-18.15.35.jpg" alt="screen-shot-2016-10-27-at-18-15-35" width="558" height="383" />

A <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/firefighters/ffcancerstudy.html">2015 study</a> by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health found that firefighters have up to 2.3x the rate of cancer compared to the average US worker. In response Vault RMS have developed a software platform that leverages biometric and situational data from wearable devices and other inputs to build a long-term health profile of workers exposed to health-compromising environments. For example, Vault tracks workers exposure to fire and carcinogenic materials and provides the data to firefighters when they need health documentation. This drives improvements in health, safety, and overall worker productivity.

The EMERGE program will conclude with opportunities to explore pilot and path-to-market opportunities with the first responder, corporate, and investor communities later this year. It'll be a great chance for many to see the way wearables are used to great effect by first responders, at times with life saving impact.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and <a href="http://www.ams-institute.org/">Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions </a> have started the world’s first major research program on autonomous floating vessels in metropolitan areas. The program, named Roboat, is the world’s first major research program on autonomous floating systems that focusses on moving people and goods, portable infrastructure and data gathering.

Roboat aims to design and deploy the world’s first fleet of autonomous boats in the city of Amsterdam from 2017. The project has a budget of  25 million euros and the initial phase will last for five years.

With over 1,000 kilometers of canals, 1,500 bridges and a long-standing focus on urban innovation, the city of Amsterdam is an ideal place to test new, water-based mobility solutions.

The canal system was once the key functional urban infrastructure of the city and today still plays a major role in recreation and tourism. Amsterdam’s waters, including bridges, canals, and the IJ river and its docks, offer plenty of opportunity to help solve current issues with transportation, mobility, and water quality.

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9303" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/Roboat-Sensable-City-3-1024x681.png" alt="roboat-sensable-city-3" width="1024" height="681" />
<h2>Moving beyond public transport to public service</h2>
Portable infrastructure is an interesting component of the project as cities experience high and low peaks of people over time, for instance when a major event takes place, rush hours starts or a during a festival. Roboat will explore the possibilities of floating infrastructures like bridges that move to the place it is needed most, extending the shore with moveable objects, or make a pop-up stage in the middle of a body of water.

Roboat aims to gather data on environmental aspects like water quality, air quality and noise, but also aims to explore ways to detect diseases at an early stage in cities, find more efficient ways to clear the canals from floating waste or new approach to dredging out the 12,000 bicycles a year which end up in the Dutch city’s canals.

“Water is the bearer of life. By focusing on the water system of the city, ROBOAT can create opportunities for new environmental sensing methods and climate adaptation. This will help secure the city’s quality of life and lasting functionality,” says Arjan van Timmeren, professor and scientific director at AMS.

With 80 percent of global economic output generated around coasts, riverbanks, and deltas and 60 percent of the world population living in these areas, researchers anticipate that outcomes from the ROBOAT projects could become a reference for other urban areas around the world and a source of international entrepreneurial initiatives and start-ups in which autonomy enters the marine world.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The future of connected vehicles is gradually becoming reality. It's an evolutionary process that relies on consumer support and legislative change as our populations must not just accommodate but transform their mindset to a new way of travel.

Given these challenges, I was excited to speak with Head of Design at BMW Motorrad, Edgar Heinrich, following the release of the BMW Motorrad VISION NEXT 100.

Unlike the gradual, cautious approach to connected vehicle designs of other companies, Heinrich and his team were given carte blanche to create a motorcycle for the future, specifically the 2040s, in honor of <a href="https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/next100.html">BMW's 100th anniversary</a>.

It's one in a series of BMW concepts that aim to anticipate where its future vision is going, and how incorporating new technologies and connectivity features will change the driving experience.

<img class="size-large wp-image-9571 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/P90238691_lowRes_bmw-motorrad-vision-.jpg" alt="p90238691_lowres_bmw-motorrad-vision" width="599" height="410" />

The bike on first glance appears like something out of a manga television series or sci-fi program. The design is minimalistic with a nod to 1920's aesthetics. The bike and its' accompaniments have several distinctive features that center around the notion of safety first. The bike is self balancing through a system that uses gyroscopes to keep the bike upright (including when stopped or parked). Heinrich notes that many people are reluctant to ride bikes because riding is hard too learn or that they will find the bike too hard to upright if it falls over and this makes riding more accessible.

The bike incorporates BMW's<a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/05/23/calm-cruel-connected-iot-hits-misses-may-vr1/"> intelligent eCall system</a> and provides a "digital companion" through which “The bike has the full range of connected data from its surroundings and a set of intelligent systems working in the background, so it knows exactly what lies ahead."

An accompanying visor acts as a virtual display, projecting the ideal riding line onto the road. “This provides beginners with feedback on their progress, as well as challenging experienced riders.” These smart glasses span the wearer's field of vision and are controlled by eye movements.

The display is similar to that in an aircraft cockpit. It shows the current angle of lean and the ideal line. If there is any deviation, the rider can correct this. If the rider fails to react or does so too late, the motorcycle corrects itself. Looking up will have a rear view mirror function. If the rider lowers his gaze a little below the normal viewpoint, a menu opens where they can trigger each function using finger gesture control.

If they lower their gaze even more, the map view opens, showing the rider their selected route. Vehicle to Vehicle communication enables riders to connect and alert fellow riders of any road changes, heavy traffic etc.

&nbsp;

<img class="size-full wp-image-9570 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/P90238741_lowRes_design-process-bmw-m.jpg" alt="p90238741_lowres_design-process-bmw-m" width="599" height="419" />

It's worth stressing that the bike is not self-driving in the traditional sense with the exception of the safety features that fall into operation if the driver is at risk. Heinrich explains, "No one is interested in a self-driving bike where you just sit there, it's about exploring and expanding the pleasure that riding gives that riding and optimizing that experience." Rather, it provides a connected experience that is safe and enjoyable.
<h2>The helmet is notably absent</h2>
Much attention by bike enthusiasts has been paid to the fact that the bike is designed with the connected glasses instead of a smart helmet. Heinrich explains that "We've worked to create a bike that is able to be more protective than anything we've created before. A user is able to focus on the pleasure of the open road, the wind in their hair, the noise and feeling of the bike instead of being encumbered by a heavy protective helmet and clothing."

It's worth considering that BMW have already prototyped a smart helmet, the<a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0247812EN/bmw-motorrad-presents-concepts-for-motorcycle-laser-light-and-helmet-with-head-up-display-innovative-technologies-for-increased-motorcycle-safety?language=en"> Head Up Display Helmet (HUD Helmet)</a>, which was revealed at CES earlier this year. It enables the projection of data directly into the rider's field of view. This means that the rider no longer has to glance at the instrument panel and thus is able to concentrate fully and without distraction on the road traffic.

All displays are freely programmable; ideally, to provide the best-possible support for rider safety, only information that is helpful and relevant to the current situation should be displayed to the rider at any given moment. The display options comprise safety-relevant information including, data relating to the technical status of the motorcycle, such as tire pressure, oil level and fuel level, travel speed and selected gear, speed limit and road sign recognition, plus warnings of impending dangers.

Connected helmets have a short but chequered history with the two companies at the forefront of their development having crashed and burned.  <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/skully-indiegogo-abuse-allegations/">Skully </a>went bankrupt. Fellow start-up <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nuviz/the-first-head-up-display-for-motorcycle-helmets/description">NUVIZ</a> have changed teams and countries. Despite successful crowdfunding in late 2013, backers are still waiting for their product.
<h2>Connected but relevant to the consumer and their environment?</h2>
As connected vehicles increase in expanding their share of the road, the role of the motorbike is more important than ever. Many other vehicles are unsuitable for older urban cities where limited parking, narrow roads and cobblestoned winding terrain make car usage impractical.

Additionally, motorbikes are far more commonplace outside Europe and America, particularly in India and Asia where their usage exceeds that of cars.

The creation of the bike is something of a designer's dream. As Heinrich explained " We are usually designing 5-10 years into the future and to be able to do something so forward thinking was just amazing."

What's in store next?  Heinrich and his team have received great feedback in the creation of the Motorrad VISION NEXT 100 and the team's enthusiasm means they "could have easily developed a series of 6 great bikes". As connected vehicles ride into our cities, this just might happen.

<p>By way of example, composition composing is an ambitious task. Discussion of up to-date study and educational sources need to be critique early within the document. Luckily the procedure for writing a dissertation paper was perfected over a few years. Instruct each candidate to spell out in writing how to deal with the circumstances. For example, in case your book is all about Personal Advancement, consider how you would like to meet your viewers.<!--more--> If you desire to enhance Language creating, you must recall there are a variety of techniques that you are competent to do so. Numerous the leading books to begin with on nonfiction books as they're written in quite straightforward vocabulary that's not rather hard to get. These are a few of the essential hints about creating, that could be followed.  <h2>I labored two jobs to accumulate enough income to utilize at your prestigious medical college.</h2></p><p>Consequently reading is actually crucial. Composing Language isn't a really simple job. Reading paper daily is, in inclusion, an extremely great and strong method of improving British creating. Reading many a few kinds of novels and publications is among the best and most effective methods of fostering your writing abilities. That's my advice to you personally personally if you're a instructor who does like to stop. I'm going to become a history teacher. Although this really is actually a place that'sn't broadly recognized, some educators still consider that holding a child's focus might actually be the lone most vital variable in figuring out how to study.</p> <p style="text-align:center"></p>  <h2>These payments for support does not have to be reimbursed.</h2><p>Moreover, the instructor may be to make certain there is enough pausing, at the appropriate interval, in what precisely is stated. Irrespective of what form our figures take, for the aims of writing, they could be human. I wish you all respectable writing, and also the camaraderie of outstanding characters. In summary, you are looking for a contemporary technological rhetoric you will be appropriate to your very own writing (24-25). Hence, you will need to find means to test every applicant. This assessment is performed by someone aside in the employee's department. What kinds of experiments required is dependant on the research theme. Plainly, an interested child ISIS more than likely to be more enthusiastic about studying. It may possibly be executed within the form of the written check or might be according to the authentic demo of skills.</p> <p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.icr.org/i/articles/af/genesis_ecp_wide.jpg" style="max-width: 500px;border: none"></p>  <h2>Tell everything you know below to us.</h2><p>There are several distinct kinds of English documents and posts which might be provided you may utilize as a method of boosting your English-language skills. Actions and services which you supply are based on ways to creatively maximize your own abilities. Some educators recommend <a href="http://topessaysforsale.com/">level best for sale</a> producing just a little novel from your child's drawings. There's absolutely no method inside this hub to anticipate each one of the possible foci which might be requested in article requests, but it might notice the finest means to find them--and easily. Writing is simply an actual art. The dreaded school composition is the most bothersome with reference to really coming up and also a topic to reveal. The regular student article offers restricted real estate to show a stage. To the conclusion that matters appear lucid to the reader, it's constantly a fantastic practice to make certain that each of the items are accurately ordered within the desk.''My British instructor shows me that type of things always! From that time, the substance can start with a concise review about what the topic is about, then followed by the primary body of critical points the writer recognized on the issue comprehensible.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While we read about the gender gap in technology almost every day, it's worth championing a sector that seems to have a strong showing of talented women in tech – the wearables industry.

Women have an extensive history in the wearables field: There's <a href="http://leahbuechley.org/">Leah Buechley</a>, inventor of the Lily Pad Arduino; academics like <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/people/picard">Dr. Rosalind Picard</a>, founder, and director of the Affective Computing research group at the MIT Media Lab; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corinnevigreux">Corinne Vigreux</a>, founder, and COO, TomTom; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossivy">Ivy Ross</a>, Vice President, Head of Design/User Experience for all Hardware Products at Google.

Then, of course, there are a plethora of wearables companies headed by women including <a href="http://www.vinaya.com/">Vinaya</a>, <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/07/07/wearables-bring-fan-love-euro-cup-dl1/">Wearable Experiments</a>, <a href="http://elektrocouture.com/">ElektroCouture</a>, <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/09/13/can-safety-wearables-stop-crimes-against-women-dl1/">Roar for Good</a> and <a href="https://webshop.bellabeat.com/?gclid=CIDO97SpsNACFUW4GwodXoAMLw">Bellabeat</a>, to name but a few. Women in wearables include academics, entrepreneurs, female directors, designers, and engineers.

They all  have been part of setting the wearables agenda and moving the technology forward. One well-known woman in the sector is Stacey Burr, former startup founder of <a href="http://www.textronicsinc.com/">Textronics</a> and now Vice President, Adidas Wearable Sports Electronics. I spoke to her recently about her experiences in the wearables space.

I was interested in learning about how Burr got her interest in wearables. She recounted:
<blockquote>“My first exposure was in the late 90’s. I was working for DuPont, in spandex and I have a tech engineering background and I was at one point finding the field of textiles very old-school and not as innovative as I would like. I heard about some researchers that were trying to integrate electronics and wires into fabric and as soon as I heard of it...It just sparked a fire in me about all the things that were possible as we started bringing technology sectors and conductive material closer to the body or onto the skin looking at lighting, heating, and physiology and motion sensors. It set me on a whole area of innovation that I’m still in love with and pursing today”.</blockquote>
Burr's time in the early stages of wearable tech means that she's seen the conversations change from technological hurdles to the killer app and the user experience and business models and how do you communicate the innovation.  She noted:

"In the earlier days, products had to be standalone because there weren't any standards or protocols and or powering objects like a smartphone that people were also carrying around with them so the phone screen opened up a whole new range of ideas around innovation."

Of course,  the technology is constantly developing and changing and we are now thinking about "How do we utilize technologies like VR or machine learning or AI in different ways."
<h2>Where is the connected clothing?</h2>
Many of us expected that connected clothing would become commonplace, but the trend has largely been limited to sporting apparel, DIY tinkering and limited custom ranges at one end of the spectrum and one-off pieces consigned to languish in museums and galleries as examples of artistic technology at the other end. Burr explains:
<blockquote>“Clothing is such an interesting challenge. Not only does the tech have to be rock solid but the items have to possess all of the familiar consumer expectations that people have for their clothing -- it needs to be fashionable, it needs to be 'wash and wearable,' it needs to meet a certain price point expectation that people associate with that category. So, not only is it an electronic device, it must meet all of the consumer requirements around clothing -- not to mention comfort. The other challenge is where you merchandise these products: are they in the clothing department or do they go over by the consumer electrical?"</blockquote>
<img class=" wp-image-10007 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/1454761_180535318815973_198620763_n.jpg" alt="1454761_180535318815973_198620763_n" width="808" height="709" />

Burr notes that bridging the nexus between technology and fashion has not always been successful:
<blockquote>"I would say in my observation that when the electronics industry has tried to approach the clothing, it's generally been unsuccessful because they have failed to understand a lot of the user consumer expectations and the imprecision that happens within the textiles supply chain. The typical assembly process for textiles is much sloppier than the electronic industry is used to, so it's hard to get it all together in a way that’s satisfactory to consumers."</blockquote>
Yet Burr and her team were responsible for a successful number of wearables including the Adidas miCoach Seamless Sports Bra. She explained:
<blockquote>"When Textronics and then Adidas bought consumer heart-rate-monitoring apparel forward, it was really a bit of a breakthrough in terms of meeting all those expectations, not to mention having FDA approval for heart rate electric sensors. It was a great example of where it all comes together in a really nice execution."</blockquote>

<h2>The litmus test for men in women's wearables</h2>
Burr's experience in managing teams in the wearables market means that she's been able to see first-hand the growth of women in technology. She notes that on her own team "we have quite an accomplished list of women in our Adidas wearables organization and are currently looking for more."

She views the representation of women in women's wearables as important in that women download fitness apps at twice the rate of men and explains "you really need a working team that represents and can speak for, and look through the lens for the consumer and I think that we have that."

Men who want to join her team are given a little test to gauge their suitability to working with women's attire:
"I have a little litmus test for some of the men that are interested in coming into our wearables team.  We put a heart rate monitoring sports bra on the table during the initial discussions and if a man can’t touch it, it's unlikely he’ll work well on our team. I’ll be thinking 'pick up the sports bra, and see it as a sensor system, as an engineering challenge with skin as the user interface!'"

Ultimately one of Burr's greatest pleasures in the wearable sector is that it is a great way to attract women who may otherwise be excluded from technology:
<blockquote>"I love that you can combine something that’s traditionally a feminine love like fashion with technology. It's the way to spark a fascination or get someone involved in the maker movement or get someone to try to program an Arduino so that they can have something that lights up or get an exposure to soldering, I love it, I love it."</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Twitter&#039;s Digits Frees Apple TV Apps From The Tyranny Of The Password</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://get.digits.com/">Digits</a>,&nbsp;Twitter's <a href="https://readwrite.com/2014/10/22/twitter-fabric-digits-phone-login">password-replacement tool</a>, has come to developers' rescue to solve one of the biggest problems for Apple TV—how do you log into apps and services when all you have is a remote control?&nbsp;</p><p>Digits for tvOS, Apple's operating system for TV apps, lets developers authenticate users without entering a phone number or confirmation code into the TV itself. Instead, the Apple TV displays a code to the user that they can enter on the Digits website.</p><p>It's a good example of Digits' push beyond its initial service, which was based solely on phone-number logins. At this year's Twitter Flight conference for developers, Twitter revealed an expansion of Digits to handle email logins as well as phone numbers. Neither of those options, though, worked well as on-screen logins for Apple TV—hence the off-screen login code.&nbsp;</p><p>This method is popular with other TV apps, like HBOgo, Showtime Anytime, CBS All Access, and others—so Twitter is now making it easy for smaller developers to match a popular TV-app login method.</p><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM0ODgxMjg5OTc4Mjg4NjA2.png"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Many mobile developers who use Twitter's Fabric services will be familiar with Digits, &nbsp;as the tool is already a means to replace passwords with a user's mobile phone number. Upon entering their mobile phone number, the user receives a confirmation code via text message from Twitter which is entered in place of the traditional email address and password. (Twitter foots the bill for these text messages, which is an additional draw for Digits.)</p><p>The text-message login worked well for many mobile users, particularly in developing countries where smartphones far outsell computers and many people may not have email addresses. But it proved a barrier to Digits' adoption by developers in Western countries, where email logins are more established and email marketing to existing users is seen as a key way of ensuring growth and retention.</p><p>Twitter isn't the only one courting Apple TV developers. Facebook announced its&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/tvos">SDK for tvOS</a> beta in November, including Facebook login for tvOS apps. But Facebook's Parse framework for mobile-app developers is <a href="https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Parse-SDK-iOS-OSX/issues/250">still testing tvOS</a>&nbsp;compatibility, with an experimental branch available on GitHub but no official support.</p><p>Digits is only one part of the software-development kits that make up the Twitter mobile development platform,<a href="https://get.fabric.io/"> Fabric</a>&nbsp;. The <a href="https://fabric.io/kits/android/crashlytics">Crashlytics kit </a>has now <a href="https://crashlytics.com/blog/introducing-crashlytics-for-tvos">expanded to include tvOS</a>, enabling developers of TV apps to analyze and fix crashes quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>It's not yet clear how Twitter plans to make money off of Fabric, which it doesn't charge for, though the company has said it anticipates Fabric developers will tap into Twitter's advertising services, too, boosting the company's overall revenues. To that end, it makes sense for Twitter to want Digits and other parts of Fabric to run on as many platforms as possible.</p><p><em>Lead photo by Owen Thomas for ReadWrite; screenshot courtesy of Twitter</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, the Apple Watch has mostly hurt other smartwatch makers, like Samsung, which fell out of the top five this quarter.</p><p>Fitbit's success stems from a number of factors. Its retail distribution is top-notch, and has been growing outside the US. Its latest trackers, the Fitbit Charge and Fitbit Surge, are selling well. And its signing up big sales to businesses that want to give fitness devices to their employees—like Target, which is including 335,000 workers in Fitbit's Corporate Wellness program.</p><p>The Apple Watch, meanwhile, is selling well, thanks to its relatively more affordable Sport line. The release of WatchOS 2, which allows apps to take better advantage of the smartwatch's built-in capabilities, may increase interest.</p><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM0OTc0ODcyNzUyMjY1Njk0.jpg"><figcaption>mi bands by Xiaomi</figcaption></figure><p><a href="http://www.mi.com/en/">Xiaomi</a> comes in third and offers an interest contrast to Apple. The company, best known as the top Android smartphone maker in China, sells fitness bands for less than $15.&nbsp;</p><p>"China has quickly emerged as the fastest-growing wearables market, attracting companies eager to compete on price and feature sets," wrote&nbsp;<a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=PRF002081">Ramon Llamas</a>, research manager for IDC's <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P29207">wearables </a>team, in the report. But Chinese companies like Xiaomi have struggled to extend their reach outside China. An example is fifth-place seller&nbsp;XTC, producer of the Y01 children's phone watch.</p><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM0OTc0Nzg1Nzc5MTc3OTUw.jpg"><figcaption>Y01 children's phone watch by BK subsidiary XTC.</figcaption></figure><p>Smaller companies hold 34% of the market, showing considerable fragmentation. There isn’t a single Android Wear manufacturer in the top five, <a href="https://readwrite.com/tag/android-wear">despite a slew of new releases this year</a>, suggesting that Google's smartwatch operating system just isn't taking off.</p><p>It seems like the real challenge for Fitbit isn't coming from makers of other wrist-worn wearables. Instead, it's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/wearables-have-a-dirty-little-secret-most-people-lose-interest/">the high drop-off rates</a>&nbsp;seen by fitness trackers. Corporate wellness programs, which sometimes offer financial incentives to use the devices, might be an answer. For now, winning a market where people stop using devices after less than a year seems like a hollow prize.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Just as anyone who wields PowerPoint can create a logo, now anyone can build a business app, thanks to Microsoft's new&nbsp;<a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/">PowerApps</a>,&nbsp;a new enterprise service to help workers create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>Introduced&nbsp;last week at its annual <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/2015/11/30/microsoft-announces-solutions-to-help-businesses-modernize-in-the-digital-world/">Convergence MEA</a>,&nbsp;Microsoft's Software as a Service (SaaS) PowerApps&nbsp;can also&nbsp;connect&nbsp;to business systems in a secure way and let employees share their apps with coworkers. The service was&nbsp;hinted at in April of this year, thanks to a leaked <a href="http://www.winbeta.org/news/microsoft-mistakenly-reveals-plans-power-apps-new-job-listing-1">job posting</a>&nbsp;seeking developers to create mobile-first, cloud-based apps.&nbsp;</p><p>The company's foray into business apps<a href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2015/11/30/introducing-microsoft-powerapps/">&nbsp;appears to be a response</a>&nbsp;to what it cites as a lag in business apps at the expense of personal apps, compounded by a lack of skilled developers, a confusion of business data stored in a range of systems and difficulties getting apps onto employee phones.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft designed its app creator to be easy to use, and the apps should work on any device using a Microsoft Office-like experience.&nbsp;</p><h2>Making Enterprise App-Creation Easy&nbsp;</h2><p>Microsoft provides a highly pictorial drag and drop interface including templates for building basic apps with a few clicks. The&nbsp;PowerApps can be connected to&nbsp;cloud services like Office 365, Dynamics CRM, Salesforce, Dropbox and OneDrive as well as on-premises systems like SharePoint, SQL Server, Oracle databases, SAP and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The apps are made available through the central PowerApps app on iOS, Android and Windows Phone, as well as on the web. Sharing them with co-workers is just a matter of sending a link to the app.&nbsp;</p><p>PowerApps complements the infrastructure of Azure, since it enables in-house developers to build data connections and APIs to existing business systems. Developers can manage existing corporate APIs using Azure Active Directory.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft's interest in business apps is nothing unique, with companies like Salesforce and Pipedrive already invested in the market. But its brand recognition and good reputation holds it in good stead.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Image courtesy of Microsoft</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

In past months, people fleeing the violence of Syria have captured the public attention, as people cross country borders with few possessions. It's a plight which brings out the compassion of many, all keen to somehow make things better, particularly in response to the inefficiency of swift, effective government action.&nbsp;</p><p>The tech industry is keen and able to lend a hand. It’s not financial aid, like the fundraising efforts of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/aidrefugees">Kickstarter</a>, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/support-refugees">Airbnb</a> and <a href="https://onetoday.google.com/page/refugeerelief">Google</a>, that makes the sector shine, but the efforts of individuals and groups showcasing what they do best: creating platforms and structures that let&nbsp;those in not-for-profit (NFP) and humanitarian aid help as many people as possible.&nbsp;</p><h2>Developers Create Mobile Mapping</h2><p>Mobile mapping is a crucial element in the journey of refugees to safety. Having Google maps, GPS or other mapping devices can mean <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syrian-refugees-technology_560c13e2e4b07681270024d9">contact with a rescue boat</a>. It can mean&nbsp;a refugee is able to <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/refugee-crisis-how-syrian-migrants-use-smartphones-avoid-traffickers-2015-9?IR=T">forgo the use of smugglers</a> and take the journey alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon arrival, mapping apps like <a href="http://arriving-in-berlin.de/">Arriving in Berlin</a>&nbsp;can offer ways to access local services, like free counseling, doctors who speak Farsi and libraries with Internet access.&nbsp;</p><p>Humanitarian organization <a href="http://www.globalinitiative.net/techfugees-mapping-smuggling-networks-for-better-responses/">Global Initiative</a>&nbsp;has been working with UK volunteer developers from <a href="http://www.techfugees.com/">Techfugees</a> to map smuggling networks and create a public&nbsp;database of&nbsp;routes. The intention is to identify future choke points or emerging smuggling markets, and to reduce the information advantage that smugglers hold over migrants.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://what3words.com/">What3words</a>,&nbsp;winner of the Innovation Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions festival of Creativity,&nbsp;was&nbsp;one of the most interesting mapping platforms to come out lately.&nbsp;</p><p>For people in displaced locations like refugee camps and informal settlements, the system enables them to exercise basic rights—like reporting crime, getting medical assistance and receiving deliveries.&nbsp;As a free plug-in universal addressing system,&nbsp;What3words&nbsp;maps the world as a 3mx3m global grid, with each of the 57 trillion 3mx3m squares being pre-allocated a fixed and unique three-word address. A geocoder turns geographic coordinates into these three-word addresses and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Developers Creating Platforms And Connecting People</p><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM0OTc0MDkzNDg0MTA4NDE5.jpg"><figcaption>Funzi creates apps with resource for refugees in Finland</figcaption></figure><p>There are many different challenges for refugees, including language and cultural differences compounding obstacles in accessing help, not to mention overall integration.&nbsp;</p><p>Many developers are intent on creating apps and websites to aid the daily lives of refugees and those who work with them. While its focus was originally on African countries,&nbsp;Finnish startup <a href="http://funzi.mobi/">Funzi </a>recognized the transferable nature of its program. So it created a series of&nbsp;learning packages to assist refugees in Finland, which includes resources on language and communication skills, everyday life and legal rights.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM0OTU2MjY4ODMzMDA5NjM0.jpg"><figcaption>Notes from Berlin's first Refugee Hackerthon</figcaption></figure><p>The startup scene in Berlin has partnered with locals and expats to develop a range of volunteer projects.&nbsp;</p><p>These include an open-source <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Refugee_Phrasebook">Refugee Phrasebook</a> in over 28 languages covering topics across legal, medical fields. It’s been widely distributed and praised by border staff, refugees, volunteers and medical workers. There's also&nbsp;a <a href="https://volunteer-planner.org/">Volunteer Planner</a> for those wishing to help refugees and refugee shelters. The planner currently has over 29,000 volunteers registered, and will roll out to other countries in 2016.</p><h2>Education And Meaningful Employment</h2><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM0OTc0NTg0NDUyNTg1OTUw.jpg"><figcaption>I Am Not A Refugee employee service created by volunteers</figcaption></figure><p>What makes the tech sector distinct from other sectors is that skills are transferable across continents, unlike many professional industries. In response to the reality of employment challenges that displaced people&nbsp;can face,&nbsp;creatives from different parts of the world joined forces to launch <a href="http://iamnotarefugee.com/">I Am Not a Refugee,</a> a site designed to help them&nbsp;find work appropriate to their skills.&nbsp;</p><p>Finnish startups created <a href="http://startuprefugees.com/">Startup Refugees</a>, a network in conjunction with government bodies to provide professional internships for asylum seekers who would otherwise be legally unable to work. Over 250 companies participate in the program.&nbsp;</p><p>In Berlin, volunteers are creating <a href="http://refugeesonrails.org/">Refugee on Rails</a>, a coding school for Berlin based refugees. It offers classes for complete beginners, as well as those who have interrupted education or have been unable to work for safety reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Classes will start in January and the school has been overwhelmed with offers for classroom space, computers, internships and work experience. Many of the refugees enrolled currently live in tents, and coworking spaces offer free memberships to participants, so they can have a warm and comfortable space to work. One of the crucial roles of the school is to assist participants with networking and social support, from attending meetups to participating in hackathons.&nbsp;</p><h2>Innovations In Jordan And Beyond: The World’s First Refugee Camp, Fab Lab</h2><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM0OTU2MzQzNzI2NDUxMzMx.png"><figcaption>Refugee camp in Syria</figcaption></figure><p>As the vast majority of refugees from Syria are living in the Middle East—namely&nbsp;&nbsp;Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt—I'd be remiss to neglect some of the interesting things happening there.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.row3d.org/">Refugee Open Ware</a> is a humanitarian organization comprised of building Fab Labs in conflict-affected areas. They provide training to displaced persons and host communities, while building solutions to the problems facing victims of conflict. It currently has a Fab Lab in <a href="http://www.morethanshelters.org/eng/projects/jordan/">Amman, Jordan</a> which trains locals in advanced manufacturing and creates 3D printed prosthetics. It's in the process of building a Fab Lab in Za'atari Refugee Camp, which lies on the Jordanian border with Syria and hosts 83,000 Syrian refugees.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://refunite.org/">Refunite</a> is a nonprofit tech organization whose mission is to reconnect refugee families across the globe, empowering refugees and displaced people to take the search for missing loved ones into their own hands—whether through a mobile phone, a computer or one of our free help lines. It uses unstructured supplementary service data to allow people to search for others registered on the service using technology similar to text messaging, in locations where full Internet access might be unavailable or unreliable.</p><h2>Room For Improvement</h2><p>The sheer number of hackathons, projects, meetings, Facebook pages, etc., is jaw dropping. What seems to be most crucial is to offer a centralized space to collate all the initiatives internationally and allow them to&nbsp;collaborate.&nbsp;</p><p>In researching this article, for example, I have seen at least six different housing platforms (mostly modeled on AirBnB), not to mention at least five different platforms for providing local, mobile based resources to refugees.&nbsp;</p><p>What needs to happen is for the tech sector to start communicating within its international networks. Berlin’s refugee hackathon is attempting to respond to this by creating an SQL database in GitHub called <a href="https://github.com/refugeehackathon/brain-backend">Meta Brain</a>. The question is, will anyone else use it?&nbsp;</p><p>Sustaining the motivation energy of volunteers and unpaid workers after the media attention of Syrian refugees and the disruption of the festive season is challenging. But what the tech scene seems intent on creating is sustainable projects. If it can avoid reinventing the wheel, it just might stand a chance of succeeding.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might have seen last week's PR disaster by IBM, which launched the #HackAHairDryer campaign to encourage women to get into tech. It was overwhelmingly <a href="http://gizmodo.com/remember-massacred-women-engineers-with-a-hairdryer-hac-1746561822">criticized by women in STEM</a> (science, technology, engineering and math) for perpetuating that notion that women aren't interested in science, unless beauty and femininity are involved. The campaign was swiftly pulled with an apology.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM0OTkyMTY4MzE3MTUzMjUw.jpg"><figcaption>You can do so much more than hack a hairdryer.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, the act of hacking everyday products to serve another purpose,&nbsp;in and of itself,&nbsp;is commendable. Think of the notion of "upcycling," which can reduce waste and save money. It's a popular trend now, and although it may not be new, opportunities for innovation seem more abundant than ever. The only limitation is your own imagination.&nbsp;</p><p>Raspberry Pi and Arduino have bought home-hacking to the masses, and there are thousands of forums, tutorials, videos and online projects that can get&nbsp;you tinkering. For beginners and those in apartments (sans tool sheds), try a <a href="https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/List_of_Hackerspaces">local hacker space</a> to learn how to disassemble appliances and use equipment safety. It's also a great way to meet a tribe of people with similar passions.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's some of the best household hacks using simple home appliances. Some will solve a problem and make your life easier, while others may simply amuse or delight.&nbsp;</p><h2>Talking Toaster</h2><p>Have you got a toaster that's warmed its last bagel? If you hate waste, try combining it with a Raspberry Pi, a speaker, amplifier and motion detector, as&nbsp;Jezra has done.&nbsp;When his toaster detects motion, it plays an audio clip. It also has a web API for accepting strings of spoken text via the espeak TTS engine.&nbsp;</p><p>Press a button on the toaster, and—flashing an LED and sending API commands to Jezra's stereo—it queues an Iron Maiden song.

Since&nbsp;its early days,&nbsp;these vacuums have attracted hackers, who have created everything from <a href="http://www.irobot.com/About-iRobot/STEM/Create-2.aspx">simulated laser scanning</a>&nbsp;to a <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/PosterBot%3a-Make-a-Marker-Writing-Robot-out-of-an-O/">writing robot</a>, as well as corresponding<a href="http://www.roboticapp.com/index.html"> robotic apps</a>&nbsp;and devices that can use webcams and offer telepresence when the owner is away.&nbsp;</p><p>The company even released <a href="http://www.irobot.com/About-iRobot/STEM/Create-2.aspx">robots</a> explicitly designed for hobbyist and educational robotics experimenters. It's the ultimate excuse to avoid cleaning your house.&nbsp;</p><h2>Create An Automated Beer Fridge</h2><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1MTU5MDYyNDI0NzY2NDc0.jpg"><figcaption>This beer fridge will never empty unnoticed.</figcaption></figure><p>There's nothing worse than running out of booze, especially with the festive season in full swing. What if your fridge could tell you how many bottles are in it, when the door is open or closed, and what the temperature is inside your fridge?&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;Internet of Things makes this possible, with the information accessible at all times on your laptop, tablet and phone. Check it out over <a href="https://github.com/InitialState/beerfridge/wiki">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Create A Solar Controller To Power Home Devices&nbsp;</h2><p>Markus Löffler created the UNplug controller as a way to go solar without being a homeowner with solar panels.&nbsp;</p><p>During the day the&nbsp;UNplug feeds electricity from the solar panel into the appliances connected to it, and charges the battery bank. Then when the sun goes down, it seamlessly switches those devices over to grid power. In the event of a blackout, UNplug then powers those same appliances from the battery bank, to satisfy critical electricity needs during an outage.&nbsp;</p><p>It is modular, scalable, moveable and connects any inverter, battery, charge controller, solar panel, for up to 1500W continuous power.

The RGB LED&nbsp;Christmas tree lights could put anyone in a holiday mood.&nbsp;</p><p>The lights, controlled by a Raspberry Pi, reflects&nbsp;<a href="http://barnoid.org.uk/christmas-twitter-tree-lights">Twitter's feelings about Christmas</a>. When Barney, its creator, discovered that Stanford University's Natural Language Processing Group released the source and data for its&nbsp;<a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/">sentiment analyser</a>,&nbsp;he decided to combine this with LED Christmas lights to tweet about Christmas.&nbsp;</p><p>The tweets come in from the Twitter streaming API (filtering for "christmas" and "xmas") and get cleaned up—with @usernames removed, hashes eliminated from hashtags, and URLs deleted. Then a desktop computer runs four instances of sentiment analysis on the tweets. The system selects messages, processes and queues them up.&nbsp;</p><p>The code on the Pi reads from the queue, and shifts an LED on to the chain with a color based on the initial sentiment letter: red for negative, green for positive, white for neutral, bright cyan for very positive and bright orange for very negative. While it may not be a perfectly accurate assessment of sentiment or opinion,&nbsp;at least the result is a&nbsp;pretty light display, making for a lovely&nbsp;Twitter of Christmas.</p><h2>Beet Box</h2><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1MTM2ODk2OTAzOTIzNzIy.jpg"><figcaption>Vegetables have never been this creative.</figcaption></figure><p>The BeetBox is an instrument that creates drum beats when the beets are touched. It is powered by a Raspberry Pi with a capacitive touch sensor and an audio amplifier in a handmade wooden enclosure.&nbsp;Source code and instructions for the BeetBox are <a href="https://github.com/scottgarner/BeetBox">viewable on GitHub</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Automatic Cat Feeder</strong></h2><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1MTM2MjI4NDk5NTgyOTQ2.jpg"><figcaption>This hack is perfect for the greedy cat.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Going away for the holidays and need to feed your pets? You might like an automatic food dispenser, courtesy of&nbsp;<a href="http://drstrangelove.net/2013/12/raspberry-pi-power-cat-feeder-updates/#more-16">this tutorial</a>. The hack combines a Raspberry Pi, a couple of continuous-rotation servos and a commercial cat feeder to make sure Fluffy stays&nbsp;well-fed.&nbsp;</p><h2>Voice Activated Coffee Machine</h2><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1MTU3OTkwMDI1MTA2NzA2.jpg"><figcaption>Get your morning coffee started from your bed.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Developer <a href="http://www.wolter.biz/2012/11/the-voice-controlled-coffee-machine/">Sascha Wolter</a>&nbsp;modified his coffee machine with a Raspberry Pi, running Java to respond to voice cues, which trigger the machine to switch off and on.&nbsp;</p><p>While it won't froth the milk—or, more importantly, bring you coffee in bed—it could be the start of something far beyond the humble <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teasmade">teasmade</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Automate Your Home Or Workplace</h2><p>You might have heard the story of "<a href="http://www.businessinsider.de/programmer-automates-his-job-2015-11?r=US&amp;IR=T">The Lazy Programmer</a>," whose workplace hacks on Github were discovered after he left for another company. He was described as the "type of guy that if something—anything—requires more than 90 seconds of his time, he writes a script to automate that."&nbsp;</p><p>One script sent a text message "late at work" to his wife and "automatically picked reasons" from a preset list, to be sent anytime there was activity with his login on the company's computer servers after 9 p.m.&nbsp;Another script was created to deal with an annoying customer. It scanned his inbox for an email from the person that used words like "help," "trouble," and "sorry," then automatically rolled the guy's database to the latest backup, with an automated reply: "No worries mate, be careful next time."&nbsp;</p><p>Among his most celebrated scripts was one that waited 17 seconds, then hacked into the coffee machine and ordered it to brew a latte. The script told the machine to wait another 24 seconds before pouring the latte into a cup, the exact time it took to walk from the Lazy Guy's desk to the coffee machine. You can enjoy the scripts on <a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts">Github</a> at your leisure.&nbsp;</p><p>Although this article focused primarily on hacking with <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino </a>and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, I'd be remiss to fail to mention other systems and microcomputers, like&nbsp;<a href="http://beagleboard.org/">Beaglebone&nbsp;</a>and Intel's <a href="https://software.intel.com/de-de/iot/hardware/galileo?gclid=CjwKEAiAkb-zBRC2upezwuyguQ4SJADZG08vkzxZ5NvwaM0xmBFIxmONb3Evyha16PuzpJvSFygGsBoCeg7w_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Galileo</a>,&nbsp;which are pretty innovative in their own right. I'd love to hear of any household hacks you've produced, especially if you've created a tutorial.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Hue And Cry Over Philips&#039; Not-So-Smart Move</title>
		<link>https://readwrite.com/2015/12/18/philips-hue-smart-home-block/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Philips was forced to reverse recent software updates this week when it was revealed that updates to its <a href="http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/">Philips Hue</a> wireless lighting system <a href="http://zatznotfunny.com/2015-12/philips-hue-excludes-3rd-party-bulbs/">cut off access to previously supported light bulbs</a> made by other companies.

Here's how Philips explained the decision:
<blockquote><em>While the Philips Hue system is based on open technologies we are not able to ensure all products from other brands are tested and fully interoperable with all of our software updates. For guaranteed compatibility you need to use Philips Hue or certified Friends of Hue products.</em></blockquote>
<figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1MjI4NzcyNjk2NzU3NTIy.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Hue You Calling A "Friend"?</h2>
Philips has had a Friends of Hue program for partners, but until recently, that was limited to Apple's HomeKit software for connected-home devices and Nest's smart-home products. Philips <a href="https://www.usa.philips.com/c-m-li/hue-personal-wireless-lighting/friends-of-hue/latest#filters=HUE_FRIENDS_SU&amp;sliders=&amp;support=&amp;price=&amp;priceBoxes=&amp;page=&amp;layout=12.subcategory.p-grid-icon">only listed Philips-manufactured devices under the "Friends of Hue" section on its website</a>.  Last week, Philips announced Bosch, Logitech, and Samsung SmartThings as partners.  All of their connected home products, applications, and platforms will integrate with Philips Hue.

That invite-only approach clashes with the principles of the <a href="http://www.zigbee.org/">ZigBee alliance</a>, a group promoting a networking standard that <a href="http://www.zigbee.org/what-is-zigbee/connectedlighting/">controls these smart lighting systems</a>. In theory, Zigbee-compatible devices should work together.

Philips is rolling back the firmware updates that blocked access to third-party bulbs, a move that should be completed by December 21. But it seems like in the long term, Philips wants manufacturers to sign up for Friends of Hue and get certified. That's a strategy that looks similar to Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mfi/">MFi program</a>, which tightly controls the devices that can work with iPods, iPhones, and iPads.

For smart-home device makers, the question will be whether to get in line and go with Philips official certification program, skip that and count on continued ZigBee support, or opt to support more open smart lighting systems. If Philips' move chastens enough hardware developers, it may find that Hue is left in the dark.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than one in five households in the US have some form of smart-home system, according to a recent research project by &nbsp;Strategy Analytics into smart-home use.&nbsp;Smart homes are growing: The number of households with some smart-home device installed grew 30% to 26.8 million in 2015, representing 21% of US households.</p><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1MzAwMDUyNTEwODk2MDk4.png"><figcaption>A smart-home control panel</figcaption></figure><h2>Safety Is A Smart Idea</h2><p>The best-selling products are water sensors which monitor water consumption and can automatically shut off the water in case of a leak and light automation throughout a property after a panic button is pushed (16%). This suggests that safety and property maintenance are key areas for smart-home purchases—even though that's not where the industry's focus has been.</p><p>The Strategy Analytics&nbsp;report identified three primary consumer groups for smart home purchases:</p><h3>Green Nesters (16% Of The Population)</h3><p>These are married families owning multiple smartphones and tablets. They are primarily interested in smart-home tech around occupancy-sensing systems for lights and heating.</p><h3>Impressers (13%)</h3><p>This groups skews towards slightly younger females in a higher income bracket residing in connected-device households. They possess an interest in motion-sensing camera technology.</p><h3>Millennial Males (7%)</h3><p>This childfree cohort is under 35 and resides in flats and apartments. They also lean towards motion-sensing camera technology.</p><h2>Buyer Statistics Beware</h2><p>Interestingly, considering the plethora of <a href="http://appcrawlr.com/ios-apps/best-apps-elderly-parents">apps</a> and smart-home <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/8-devices-elderly-relatives-safe-at-home/">devices</a> targeting the elderly, they are notably absent in Strategy Analytics' numbers. Could this be because they lack the technology know-how or interest—or that younger relatives typically purchase and install such items for them, distorting the numbers?&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1Mjk5OTg2NDc1NzUxOTAy.jpg"><figcaption>Security camera, Nest cam</figcaption></figure><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"></blockquote><p>Bill Ablondi, a director of smart-home research at Strategy Analytics, says:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Interactive security—professionally monitored security with Internet-connected home control and automation capabilities—is a big draw in the US market. We believe that this category will continue to grow as companies offer low cost systems and services to attract a broader market. Cable TV operators such as <a href="http://corporate.comcast.com/news-information/news-feed/the-future-of-the-home-bringing-the-power-of-the-cloud-to-home-management">Comcast </a>and <a href="http://www.timewarnercable.com/en/intelligenthome/overview.html">Time Warner Cable</a> are healthy growth of their interactive security services as is market leader ADT.</p></blockquote><p>Ablondi alludes to ways that smart-home devices could find their way into homes of consumers that aren't actively seeking them out:</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p>Data analytics for predicting failure in heating systems and major appliances will become an extension of the maintenance contracts retailers, energy providers, and manufacturers offer.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Smart-home devices could do more than report malfunctions: They could predict them, too, reducing maintenance and replacement costs.</p><p>It is indeed possible to envision a home which goes beyond the coffeemaker, thermostat, smoke detector, and camera to multiple control points in the home. Consumer adoption has some way to go. But with established brands like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Samsung building awareness for smart-home technologies the market is set to increase, especially as technological enhancements like voice recognition make the devices more appealing.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Buffer&#039;s Gift To Other Startups: How To Grow Gracefully</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are dozens if not hundreds of companies that promise to help you manage social media. One of those companies, <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a>, has managed to stand out from the pack for an unusual reason: its work practices and culture.</p><p>When I mentioned to a few people that I'd be interviewing Joel Gascoigne, Buffer's founder and CEO, their responses varied. Some mentioned the product—"Oh, I use that all the time"—while others mentioned their famous workplace transparency—"Did you know they release their salaries online?"</p><p>But my favorite was this one: "They sound awesome. I want to live like them."</p><p>So I set about trying to answer that. If not quite living Gascoigne's life, could I document for ReadWrite's readers how to work like him and his colleagues?</p><h2>Sharing Buffer's Success</h2><p>As it happens, I spoke to Gascoigne on the eve of the company's&nbsp;<a href="https://open.buffer.com/buffer-acquires-respondly/">announcement that Buffer had acquired Respond.ly</a>, expanding it from social media sharing to customer service. It's just the latest sign of Buffer's success.</p><p>Under Gascoigne, Buffer has been an excellent narrator of its own victories and struggles—Buffer's fastidious commitment to transparency makes its <a href="https://open.buffer.com/">company blog</a> read like a self-published business case study. Here's what I learned.</p><h3>Your Best Team May Not Be Where You Are</h3><p>Buffer has experienced massive growth over the past year. It now has 70 employees around the globe, up from <a href="https://open.buffer.com/buffer-december-2014-new-company-structure-5m-annual-revenue/">29 a year ago</a>. Distributed workforces are <a href="https://readwrite.com/2015/02/24/stack-exchange-remote-employees">becoming more of an accepted practice</a>. Distinct from simply working from home and checking in to a centralised office or splitting time between workplace and residence, distributed companies like Buffer have employees across continents. It's literally miles away from the traditional team sharing an egalitarian, open-plan sea of desks that's popular in most startups.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>See also: <a href="https://readwrite.com/2015/02/24/stack-exchange-remote-employees">Why Stack Exchange Doesn't Corral Workers Into An Office</a></strong></p></blockquote><p>There are many reasons why distributed workforces are advantageous. There's the obvious ones like cultural and linguistic diversity and the "always open" scenario of multiple time zones. But there's also the opportunity to recruit top talent from all over the world, whether in Baltimore, Bangladesh, or Berlin. &nbsp;</p><p>It means employees have the option of working anywhere with Wi-Fi, be it a coffee shop, beach, or mountaintop.&nbsp;</p><h3>Meeting The Distributed Challenge</h3><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1MjA3MjY1MTExMTUxODkw.png"><figcaption>So many voices to be heard&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>While the nomadic lifestyle has many merits, it also has a number of <a href="http://qz.com/230998/how-to-run-a-team-of-people-who-never-see-each-other/">challenges</a>. You'll need stellar communication to ensure that a workforce is able to operate as well as it would in a physical office.&nbsp;</p><p>Buffer uses a range of platforms to keep its' employees communicating like <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> and <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>. <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Google Hangouts</a> and <a href="https://www.sqwiggle.com/">Sqwiggle</a> are also efficient ways to chat without the need for emails or phone calls. Don't forget to accommodate everyone in their different time zones: If you have employees in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, someone's going to be miserable no matter when you schedule a call. Fairness means rotating the burden—and paying attention to time zones.</p><h2>Make Rewards Meaningful</h2><p>Rethink perks. Buffer isn't the only company to use job titles like <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/aug/26/chief-happiness-officer-cho-employee-workplace-woohoo-google">Happiness Hero</a>. But how do you define happiness? Is it the thrill of a zany costume party or a delicious catered lunch? Or is it when staff feel appreciated, communicate effectively, and get the opportunity to grow in a workplace?</p><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1MjA3MzY4NDU4Nzc1MTcx.jpg"><figcaption>A pet-friendly workplace is good—but real perks require work.</figcaption></figure><p>"We want staff to live their best life, which we reflect in our mission statement," says Gascoigne. Easier said than done. Buffer offers unlimited paid vacation days—a perk that's as much about accounting tricks as staff benefits, since employers don't have to record accrued vacation on their books as an obligation, and taking any vacation time now requires approval from a manager and engenders scrutiny from colleagues.</p><p>Sure enough, employees at Buffer saw through the policy and <a href="https://open.buffer.com/unlimited-vacation-tips/">didn't take time off</a>. The company had to introduce $1,000 bonuses for staff to encourage them to make use of their time off. Another key change: Gascoigne and his cofounder, Leo Widrich, started taking vacations, which set a positive example for employees.</p><p>Even a small, bootstrapped startup can benefit from ensuring that staff take proper breaks and find interesting ways to reward staff that actually mean something to them. And it helps to set an example from the beginning—a mistake Gascoigne and Widrich made by not taking vacations.</p><p>Buffer has also made group getaways an institution, Gascoigne says:&nbsp;"We have two Buffer Retreats per year, where we gather the whole team in a single location. We spend a week working together and also do activities like sightseeing, boating and jet-skiing. We've been to retreats in places like Lake Tahoe, Sydney, Thailand, Cape Town, and Iceland."</p><h3>Share Ideas And Failures&nbsp;</h3><p>Buffer decided early on to document its mission statement, work practices, and experiments. One such trial was a slightly odd journey into <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/aug/26/chief-happiness-officer-cho-employee-workplace-woohoo-google">self-management</a>. But Buffer also exposed its own failings, like a <a href="https://overflow.buffer.com/2014/06/11/how-to-think-about-security-at-startups-its-a-never-ending-job/">major security breach in 2014.</a> It also <a href="https://overflow.buffer.com/2014/06/11/how-to-think-about-security-at-startups-its-a-never-ending-job/">broadcasts employee salaries</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://overflow.buffer.com/2014/06/11/how-to-think-about-security-at-startups-its-a-never-ending-job/">Buffer's corporate finances</a>.</p><p>I was curious if this constant sharing had negative consequences.&nbsp;</p><p>Gascoigne said that one program with sharing feedback failed because Buffer's team didn't take its distributed nature into account.</p><p>"The problem was that due to timezones, other people were able to read the feedback before the intended staff member," he said.&nbsp;The idea was scrapped after a couple of months.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, when done right, Buffer's style of transparency can also lead to a greater community following as other people <a href="https://open.buffer.com/transparent-when-it-hurts/">relate to your failures</a>.</p><h2>Growth With Grace</h2><p>Buffer's latest <a href="https://open.buffer.com/buffer-acquires-respondly/">post</a> about its acquisition of Respond.ly could read as an etiquette guide on how to be a nice-guy acquirer. Buffer and Respond.ly built up a relationship over time, which started with a simple phone call. Buffer then sought professional advice on whether Respond.ly's features were something they should build or buy. Gascoigne and his team decided to go with a product which they felt aligned with their own ethos.</p><p>With a rapidly growing team, Buffer now has the challenge of whether its practices can be sustainable in a larger sphere. Will Buffer employees continue meticulously blogging about each progression and transgression? Will they be able to do team retreats with hundreds of employees? Will policies like unpaid vacation time require more rigid rules over time?</p><p>There's not one answer to these questions, nor will an answer stay right over time. The important thing is that Buffer keeps learning—and keeps sharing. So should you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Android N To Use Oracle’s OpenJDK For Java APIs</title>
		<link>https://readwrite.com/2015/12/30/openjdk-java-android-n/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>News from a&nbsp;“mysterious Android codebase commit” has revealed that Google is replacing its implementation of the Java application programming interfaces (APIs) in Android N with <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a>, the open source version of Oracle’s Java Development Kit (<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">JDK</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>The news came to light&nbsp;in an article last month in  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10803775">Hacker News</a>&nbsp;with news of a&nbsp;<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libcore.git/+/51b1b6997fd3f980076b8081f7f1165ccc2a4008">code commit</a>, which shows 8,902 files were committed with OpenJDK instead of the&nbsp;proprietary JDK version. Google has confirmed the use of OpenJDK in Android N, the next-generation version of its operating system.&nbsp;</p><h2>Doing The Java Dance&nbsp;</h2><p>The relationship between Google and Oracle has been historically fractious, culminating in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_America,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc.">Oracle vs Google</a>&nbsp;legal case where&nbsp;Oracle attempted to sue Google for copyright and patent infringement of Java APIs August 2010. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle</a> purchased Sun in January 2010, acquiring Java, and continued developing it.)&nbsp;</p><p>In implementing Android OS, Google wrote its own version of Java, but used the same names, organization, and functionality as the Java API.&nbsp;Google released the Android <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit">software development kit</a> (SDK) on November 12, 2007. Google negotiated with Sun about possible partnership and licensing deals for Java, but no agreement was reached.</p><p>Oracle sued Google for copyright and patent infringement in August 2010. The case went to court with a ruling&nbsp;that APIs are not subject to copyright with a counter appeal by Oracle which had the<a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2014/11/10/oracle_v_google_13-1021.opinion.5-7-2014.1.pdf"> decision reversed</a>&nbsp;but left open&nbsp;the possibility that Google might have a fair use defense.&nbsp;In October 2014, Google petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.&nbsp;The petition was denied by the United States Supreme Court on June 29, 2015 and the case currently resides in a lower court without closure.</p><p>In light of the recent news, it's easy to wonder if the&nbsp;legal dispute between Oracle and Google has been settled out of court, or if it's a coincidence that&nbsp;Google is adopting OpenJDK.&nbsp;Google told <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/12/29/google-confirms-next-android-version-wont-use-oracles-proprietary-java-apis/">VentureBeat </a>that the legal dispute is still ongoing, so it couldn't comment on whether the code change is related to the dispute.</p><p>There has been increased dissatisfaction with Google's Java Android implementation from Android developers, with some seeking alternatives to bring the language up to date.&nbsp;</p><p>Languages such as <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> (developed by the creators of Android's official IDE <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">Jetbrains</a>) have sought to fill some of these gaps by offering features missing from the current Android implementation of Java such as static typing, reduction of boiler plate code alongside 100% Java interoperability. Others have wondered if Google might even try to replace Android's reliance on Java completely with languages such as <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> or maybe if Hell freezes over, even <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a> now there's a Linux compiler? Although these options are a lot of work and unlikely in the short term future.&nbsp;</p><p>At any rate, this news is a step forward to reduce the inconsistencies Android developers experience. Will the court case be resolved any time soon? With potentially monumental consequences for whether APIs can be trademarked, we'll have to wait and see.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most resolutions revolve around physical self-improvement—diet, exercise, and the like. Why not take a breath and tend to your digital health as well? Here are some ways to make your online life a little more manageable, so you can take better care of your colleagues, customers, and friends.</p><h2>Use A Password Manager</h2><p>Every time there's a security breach we are warned <a href="https://readwrite.com/2014/05/06/lastpass-joe-siegrist-heartbleed-password-manager-privacy-security-builders">to choose new, unique passwords for affected apps and websites</a>. If you're not gifted with an eidetic memory, good luck remembering them all. Password managers can store passwords for your  email, banking accounts and  social sites like Facebook and Twitter.&nbsp;<a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> and <a href="https://www.logmeonce.com/">LogMeOnce</a> are a couple of good options.</p><h2>Unplug Your Screens</h2><p>When you're passionate about your work, it's easy to spend a good chunk of the day in contact with a screen or electronic device. We won't judge you if you spend all day in front of a screen, go home and eat dinner in front of Netflix, and finish by reading an ebook in bed, it's great for your body and mind to shake it up. Grow some plants, take a cooking class, visit museums and flea markets, go bike riding, play board games, and cultivate other screen-free interests. Bonus points if you can power down your phone while you're at it.</p><p>Unplugging is hard, so start with a simple resolution, like avoiding social media an hour before bedtime.</p><h2>Commit To Showing Up</h2><p>Are you one of those people who RSVP "yes" to every tech meetup and Facebook invite but fail to attend?&nbsp;Being a no-show just to ease your <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2015/09/30/fomo_what_s_the_psychology_behind_the_fear_of_missing_out.html">FOMO</a>&nbsp;isn't just rude. It can&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.thefetch.com/2013/08/03/the-golden-rules-of-meetup-etiquette/">impact the ability for others</a> to attend and for organizers to cater appropriately. Use a calendar app to plan your time and don't overcommit.</p><p>Once you do show up, be present. It's easy to spot newbies standing alone. Don't leave them standing there. Introduce yourself and invite them to join your small group or introduce them to others. Networking is not just about what you get out of it but what you can offer also.&nbsp;</p><h2>Contribute To The Community&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTM1NTMwNjQ2MzUyMjA1MDc0-2.jpg"><figcaption><a href="http://www.tentlandia.com/stories/using-tech-good-techfugees-australia">Techfugees hackathon</a> in Sydney, Australia</figcaption></figure><p>Tech folks are generally a benevolent bunch. Whether helping paint a new coworking space&nbsp;or running meetup groups for love not money, people in the startup scene is generous with their time and money. If you would like to get on board, think about how you can help and commit to concrete actions like <a href="https://readwrite.com/2015/12/11/tech-refugees-aid-organizations">helping refugees</a>, employing <a href="http://www.code2040.org/">traditionally disadvantaged folk</a> in your workplace, or instituting a workplace scheme where staff can receive time off to work on volunteer projects.&nbsp;</p><h2>Keep Your Devices Clean</h2><p>If you've ever had to get sticky milk or melted chocolate from in between keyboard keys, you'll you'll know the pain of a dirty laptop.&nbsp;After spilling red wine on my laptop, I now have a rule against drinking and typing to avoid a repeat performance.&nbsp;Buy a keyboard protector for a handful of change, invest in a laptop bag or cover, and clean your device regularly. Don't forget your mouse, smartphone screen, and headphones.&nbsp;</p><h2>Change Your Workplace&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTM1NTMwMDY1NzI2MzEzNzQ2-2.jpg"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>A change of location can be a great way to revitalize your working week, especially if you don't have a traditional office. Try a <a href="http://coworkingmap.org/">coworking space</a>, library, or coffee shop. To stay in touch with your colleagues, look at reducing time reading and writing emails and explore options like&nbsp;<a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Google Hangouts</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.sqwiggle.com/">Sqwiggle</a>. Team chat software builds stronger bonds, while email piling up feels like a chore.</p><p>If you do have an office and don't have flexible arrangements, give yourself the opportunity to explore your neighborhood in your lunch hour. Try 5 minutes of stretching for each hour of sitting or a quick walk before work each day.</p><p>Have Fun With Colleagues</p><p>Most of us spend more time with our colleagues than our families and friends. Yet it's easy to fall into a trap where your only downtime involves alcohol after work, a boring routine that can leave you worse for wear the next morning. It's true some people don't like to socialize with their colleagues, but I recommend getting to know the people I work with. &nbsp;Ask around for suggestions. Go for a picnic, bring some board games into work, start a book club, or have a weekly brown bag lunch together outside of the office.&nbsp;</p><h2>Keep Your Resume Updated</h2><p>The tech industry moves fast. It's also one of the few sectors that is always hiring. Keep your industry knowledge current by attending training courses and conferences. Research companies that you might like to work for in the future and don't limit yourself to your country of residence—most tech jobs are easily transferable internationally. If you haven't looked at your resume since you started your current job, it's not a bad idea to have a look at it with a fresh eye.&nbsp;</p><h2>Think About Your Digital Legacy</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTM1NTI5MjM0MTEzMjQzNzc5-2.jpg"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>No one wants to think of their own mortality, but it's inevitable. Do you really want your mother who calls the Internet "The Google" to figure out what to do with your email and social media accounts? It's no joking matter—one famous online writer, Leslie Harpold, <a href="http://workbench.cadenhead.org/news/3579/why-leslie-harpolds-sites-disappeared">had her sites disappear after her family decided to let them expire</a>. Facebook has a <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/02/adding-a-legacy-contact/">legacy option</a> where you can nominate a friend to manage your account upon your death, while&nbsp;<a href="https://support.twitter.com/forms/privacy">Twitter</a> requires a person authorized to access them on behalf of your estate or an immediate family member to contact them directly.</p><p>&nbsp;Then of course there's your email accounts, and retail accounts like Apple's iTunes, Amazon, and eBay and probably a handful more that you use every that you never thought you'd ever cancel. Fortunately, there's a suit of services that can help you with everything from managing your digital accounts to donating your online music library to a loved one.&nbsp;</p><p>While you're contemplating the afterlife, it's a great time to also take a few minutes to register for <a href="https://organize.org/">organ donation</a>.</p><h2>Resolved: Let's All Do Better</h2><p>It's hard to change established habits and practices. I'm going to try to avoid using my mobile phone in bed, and I plan on sitting out on the balcony more often rather than in front of my heater. Now you tell me: What are your intentions for 2016?&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Mark Zuckerberg Is About To Get A Smart-Home Headache</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Sunday night, Facebook founder  Mark Zuckerberg announced his plans for 2016 on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck?fref=ts">Facebook page</a>. The task: build an artificially intelligent smart home.
<blockquote>My personal challenge for 2016 is to build a simple AI to run my home and help me with my work. You can think of it kind of like Jarvis in Iron Man. I'm going to start by exploring what technology is already out there. Then I'll start teaching it to understand my voice to control everything in our home—music, lights, temperature, and so on.</blockquote>
Zuckerberg's ambitions go beyond standard smart-home features to include supervision of his newborn daughter and facial recognition to let in visiting friends.  He also hopes his efforts will enable him to  visualize data in virtual reality.

The tech billionaire said a part of the motivation behind this year's challenge was the reward of building things with his own hands. Zuckerberg has lamented that it's been a long time since he got to touch code at Facebook. Exploring artificial intelligence will help him connect better with the AI scientists <a href="https://readwrite.com/2015/06/02/facebook-ai-research-paris">Facebook is snapping up around the globe</a>.
<h2>A Smart Guy Is About To Meet The Not-So-Smart Home</h2>
<figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTM1NjUwNzE5Njc5MTU4NzUw-2.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Amazon Echo</figcaption></figure>We applaud Zuckerberg's ambitions here. But we think he's going to run into trouble, because the application programming interfaces and software-development kits behind most smart-home products available today are immature and limited. "Developer preview" is just a nice way of saying "Don't call us if your software breaks."

While there have been many announcements in the industry, few developers have really put these APIs through their paces. Zuckerberg's high-profile promise could be the accelerant that forces companies to really test and improve their smart-home developer tools.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-SK705DI-Echo/dp/B00X4WHP5E">Amazon Echo</a>, a voice-activated speaker, might be a place to start. There, Zuckerberg can use Amazon's Alexa Voice Service. It was <a href="https://readwrite.com/2015/07/31/amazon-alexa-voice-service-developer-preview-echo">announced last July</a> and is—you guessed it—<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service">still in "developer preview."</a>

Then of course there's <a href="http://www.wink.com/about/">Wink </a>and its wall-mounted touchscreen home automation service for lighting, home security, temperature control, and so on. Its API—<a href="http://docs.winkapiv2.apiary.io/#">which has changed since its initial launch, breaking older applications built on it</a>—has some interesting concepts, like Robots for automated tasks, which Zuckerberg might explore. Wink was recently sold out of bankruptcy to Flextronics, so it seems like a safe bet to build on.

Some of what Zuckerberg aims to do may be available off the shelf, or he might be able to automate some tasks using tools like <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> or Zapier. <a href="https://www.doorbird.com/">Doorbird</a> might be an option for front-door facial recognition. The only question there will be what Zuckerberg will use for a database. Before <a href="https://readwrite.com/2012/05/30/facebooks-acquisition-of-facecom-gives-a-new-look-to-search">Facebook bought Face.com in 2012</a>, that startup offered a facial-recognition API. It will be intriguing to see if Zuckerberg uses a private Facebook API or <a href="http://blog.mashape.com/list-of-10-face-detection-recognition-apis/">opts for one of the newer services</a>.

Were really curious how Zuckerberg will implement AI <a href="http://www.washington.edu/news/2012/04/05/children-perceive-humanoid-robot-as-emotional-moral-being/">robot childcare</a>. Perhaps he'll take inspiration from Neal Stephenson's science-fiction novel <em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/827.The_Diamond_Age">The Diamond Age</a></em>, in which a young girl is raised by an artificially intelligent e-book.

Ultimately the biggest challenge may well be cajoling devices to communicate with each other. Even when this is theoretically possible, glitches often turn up, because the creators of smart-home APIs haven't tested all the possible combinations of devices they might encounter.  This could prove far more frustrating than creating the smart-home AI. What good is a smart butler who just says, "I'm sorry, Mark, I can't do that"?

		<title>Why The Blockchain, Not Bitcoin, Is What&#039;s Fascinating Builders</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few years ago, Bitcoin, the distributed digital currency, was the hottest thing to roll through the intersection of finance and technology. It gained significant interest amongst those keen to create a peer-to-peer, cashless currency.

But its attempt to enter the mainstream has been marred by reports of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-silkroad-agent-idUSKCN0R027F20150831">thefts</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/03/bitcoin-2015-make-or-break-year">poor marketing</a>, and a general lack of comprehension by the general populace.

That's too bad, because Bitcoin is really just one application of a much broader technology: the distributed ledger known as the blockchain. And fortunately, people are beginning to understand the blockchain as a phenomenon distinct from Bitcoin specifically and digital currency in general.

The blockchain's strength lies in how it decentralizes transactions of all sorts, allowing all kinds of digital assets to be safely and permanently exchanged. It also promises the potential to create records that can't be erased by attacking some central store of data. Because of the features, the blockchain possesses the potential to increase security and accountability in a range of industries.

Here are just a few new ways the blockchain is being used. Some may surprise you.
<h2>The Art Of The Blockchain</h2>
<figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTM1NjY2Mzk3NjUxOTY2NDMw-2.gif" alt="" /><figcaption><a href="http://www.buro247.com/me/culture/news/worlds-mostexpensive-gif.html">'Balloon Dog Deflated' by Michael Green</a></figcaption></figure>Digital artwork, which can include soundscapes, augmented reality, GIFs, and pixel art, is growing and diversifying as a medium. You can even buy recordings of brainwaves. Yet complications can arise when artists attempt to sell digital art—or even distinguish it as theirs. As Douglas Davis <a href="http://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Winter09/9-1/_pdf/3-Davis_Work_of_Art.pdf">wrote in his 1991 essay</a> "The Work Of Art In The Age of Digital Reproduction":
<blockquote>The fictions of "master" and "copy" are now so entwined with each other that it is impossible to say where one begins and the other ends.</blockquote>
Davis, sadly, passed away two years ago. But surely someone should attempt to write "The Work Of Art In The Age Of The Blockchain."

In Davis's era, the authenticity of digital art was difficult to verify. Was a file an "original" or one of an edition? In contrast to the conventions established in Walter Benjamin's age of "mechanical reproduction," what did those terms even mean?

Companies like Berlin's <a href="https://www.ascribe.io/">Ascribe</a> and New York's <a href="https://monegraph.com/index.html">Monegraph</a> are using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)">blockchain</a> to log each transfer of a work (just as a similar blockchain does for bitcoins), so art ownership at any time cannot be disputed. Digital art can be transferred, consigned, or loaned without losing attribution. The location of the work throughout the internet can also be recorded to document its history.

We won't begin to address the cultural issues that Benjamin and Davis's essays raise with respect to this use of technology, but they're interesting to think about, too.
<h2>The Potchain</h2>
Although legal in a handful of US states, marijuana's use, sale, and possession is still illegal under federal law. The buying and selling of marijuana is difficult to navigate for both retailers and consumers. It's primarily a cash-based industry, as banks fear <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/13/banks-marijuana-businesses_n_7057138.html">prosecution</a> for handling the funds.

While there are a number of bitcoin-based services like <a href="http://www.potcoin.com/">Potcoin</a>, only recently has another option become available. <a href="http://www.sericapay.com/">Serica</a> uses the blockchain to track and record every purchase of medical marijuana, and gives companies an easy way to accept payment online. The startup has already <a href="http://www.entrepreneur-ideas.org/pot-startups-and-marijuana-angel-investors-are-growing-fast/#.Vo04DJMrJE4">signed a deal with the second largest e-commerce site for medical cannabis</a> to become its sole online payment option.
<h2>Music That's Off The Blockchain</h2>
<figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTM1NjcwNTAyODM1NDA2ODU4-2.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>In October, Ujo Music released a<a href="https://alpha.ujomusic.com/#/imogen_heap/tiny_human/tiny_human"> prototype service</a> featuring a downloadable single by artist Imogen Heap. It was a practical example of how a blockchain-based music industry might function.

Creators and rights holders register works and their stakes in those works on the blockchain, and payments are delivered automatically and instantly using smart contract technology. Artists may also publish policies for how their music may be used, facilitating an open marketplace in which anybody can innovate a new business model, app or service as long as they meet the terms of those policies.

Currently, payments can be only made via bitcoin but credit-card support is on the way. Beyond its initial announcement, the people behind the Ujo project have been rather quiet.

Ad-free streaming service and marketplace <a href="http://peertracks.com/index.html">Peertracks</a> is still in the early stages but is attracting interest. PeerTracks allows tipping, patronage-style support, and even the buying and trading of limited-edition, tradable VIP passes for artists, using blockchain technology to track their transfer.

In this instance, the blockchain  serves as a global database for copyrights, a means of payment for all music-related transactions.  It also provides artists with transparent accounting, automatically split up royalty payments and the capability to create their Notes so they can get discovered and engage their fan bases. Fans can interact, participate and even benefit from the success of their favorite artists. Peertracks' beta launch is planned for the <a href="https://coinreport.net/conversation-cedric-cobban-co-founder-peertracks/">first quarter of 2016</a>.
<h2>The Blockchain Shall Rule</h2>
In May last year, the Isle of Man began the first government-run blockchain project, using the blockchain to create a registry of digital-currency companies operating on the island.  This was intended to  stop money laundering, prevent terrorist financing, and aid international trade sanctions, as financial flows could be traced definitively to the specific individual involved.

Honduras has also turned to the blockchain with the help of a US company, <a href="http://factom.org/">Factom, </a>as a mean to end <a href="http://blog.factom.org/post/119366700609/honduras-to-build-land-title-registry-using?is_related_post=1">land-title fraud</a><a href="http://www.coinfox.info/news/2052-honduras-will-use-blockchain-to-build-a-secure-land-title-record-system">. </a>

“In the past, Honduras has struggled with land title fraud,” said Peter Kirby, Factom's president. “The country’s database was basically hacked. So bureaucrats could get in there and they could get themselves beachfront properties.”

Factom's system includes verified timestamps and provides a distributed mechanism to lock in data, making it independently auditable. However the project has not been completed in its expected time frame. <a href="http://blog.factom.org/post/135920051224/a-humble-update-on-the-honduras-title-project">Updates</a> describe a project that's encountering political delays despite support from figures high up in the government.

Despite the obstacles in Honduras, Factom is continuing its work in land titles, currently working with <a href="https://bitsapphire.com/">BitSapphire</a> on an anticorruption tool to manage the land municipal registry databases in Kosovo. They plan to use the Factom API to build a cryptographic record to prove the databases haven’t been corrupted.
<h2>Open Ledgers For Everyone</h2>
The Linux Foundation recently announced a new, collaborative <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2015/12/linux-foundation-unites-industry-leaders-advance-blockchain">Open Ledger</a> project to advance blockchain technology, teaming with tech firms such as IBM and Intel, the London Stock Exchange Group and big banks such as JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and State Street. Their aim is to advance blockchain technology and:
<blockquote>... develop an enterprise grade, open source distributed ledger framework and free developers to focus on building robust, industry-specific applications, platforms and hardware systems to support business transactions.</blockquote>
The collaboration is intended to create cross-industry open standards to transform business transactions. That banking and financial trading services have come on board demonstrates the appeal of the blockchain even to traditionally conservative industries.

The blockchain has not fully come into its full potential by any means. Most projects seem to be in early stages of beta testing and trials. Yet it's clear there are advances on an almost daily basis. It will be interesting to see the outcomes of the Open Ledger project and what the future holds for the blockchain, especially in newer applications like <a href="https://www.ambisafe.co/egov/">voting </a>and <a href="http://insidebitcoins.com/news/tierion-and-philips-bring-blockchain-technology-to-healthcare-sector/35494">healthcare</a>. While the technology will progress quickly, it's not as clear that our political systems and everyday users will be able to keep up.

It won't be bits that hold back the blockhain, in other words. It will be us humans.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>So You Want To Build An App? Twitter Has A Playbook</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twitter the company is sometimes burdened by sharing a name with Twitter the app. It knows a lot more about building mobile apps than its simple-seeming flagship might suggest.</p><p>That's the not-so-subtle message of Twitter's first edition of a&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2016/mobile-app-playbook-lessons-learned">playbook for mobile apps</a>&nbsp;that developer advocate Bear Douglas posted last week. At <a href="https://readwrite.com/2015/10/21/twitter-flight-fabric">Twitter's 2015 Flight developer conference</a>, Twitter showed off Vine and Periscope, two apps it acquired and has continued to develop in-house using Fabric, a set of programming frameworks and toolkits unveiled in 2014.</p><p>Douglas described Twitter's experiences using its own tools to build two showcase apps: magnetic poetry app&nbsp;<a href="http://cannonballapp.io/">Cannonball</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://furni.xyz/">Furni</a>, a sample furniture-store app. (These aren't new lines of business for Twitter—more like coding examples, as they're both available as open source on GitHub.)&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM1Nzg3NjQ1NjUyNDk2MzU0.png"><figcaption>Learn to create a furniture-store app with Furni</figcaption></figure><p>This post covered two parts of development: prototyping and testing.</p><p>Douglas recommends developers use an old-fashioned whiteboard for early collaboration as well as digital wireframing for remote teams. The goal should be to get an "ugly" version working to test interactions, then work on prettying it up, Douglas writes.</p><p>For testing, there's nods to Fabric tools like <a href="https://fabric.io/kits/android/crashlytics/summary">Crashlytics</a>. Douglas stresses that apps that crash a lot tend to get abandoned. And she recounts how her team monitored colleagues who offered to help with early testing of Cannonball:</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p>"The two people who installed but didn’t actually test our day-before-Flight build? Dead to us."</p></blockquote><p>Beta testers: You're on notice.</p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM1Nzg3MTU0NjgzOTk2ODAz.jpg"><figcaption>Magnet poetry app, Cannonball</figcaption></figure><p>Twitter is encouraging developers to tweet their own tips by using the hashtag #MobileAppPlaybook, and it will consider adding the tips to their future posts. Readers can expect&nbsp;&nbsp;a new guide to be published roughly every week. It'll be interesting to see the next guide. You can follow it on the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer">Twitter Developer Blog</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Where CES 2016 Missed The Mark</title>
		<link>https://readwrite.com/2016/01/08/ces-2016-misses/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[CES 2016, the big technology event in Las Vegas this week, is a place where the best and brightest that the tech world can offer. It provided in a dazzling display of demonstrations, discussions and debates.

For every huge hit that receives accolades and media coverage, there are those products that don't quite make the mark. They aren't short of innovation or ingenuity. They identify a problem and attempt to provide a solution, and as such, we can learn from them.

The failures occur because sometimes the technology hasn't quite caught up with the creator's mission; the product is overdesigned; or it's too expensive and for a very limited audience. Here are some of those products that have much potential but aren't quite there yet.
<h2>My UV Patch</h2>
<figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTM1NzE3MjY0NTYwMjM3MTg3-2.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/loreal-debuts-first-ever-stretchable-electronic-uv-monitor-at-the-2016-consumer-electronics-show-300200110.html">My UV Patch</a> is a sensor wearable tattoo by L'Oreal designed to monitor UV exposure and help consumers educate themselves about sun protection. It's a transparent adhesive half the thickness of an average strand of hair with a patch that contains photosensitive dyes that factor in the baseline skin tone and change colors when exposed to UV rays to indicate varying levels of sun.

After time outside, the wearer can  take a photo of the patch and upload it to a corresponding mobile app, which analyzes the varying photosensitive dye squares to determine the amount of UV exposure the wearer has received. The app then advises if it's time to move into the shade or apply sunscreen.

UV Patch in theory has a lot going for it. It's commendation to see stretchable electronic sensors in healthcare. It's also great to see a wearable that measures UV exposure rather than simply sun exposure, as UV rays can also be damaging in the shade and under trees. But the limitation of the patch is that the wearer needs to keep taking pictures of the patch and uploading it to the app, something which would become easy to forget or bothersome after a period of time. And while waterproof, L'Oréal didn't mention whether the patch would cope with a routine of bathing with soap, application of sunscreen, and exposure to salt and chlorine.

Statistically, skin cancers are disproportionately concentrated on the head compared with other parts of the body, <a href="http://www.skincancer.org/prevention/sun-protection/shade/seek-the-shade">with the face, nose, and ears particularly vulnerable</a>. Hard to see anyone putting this patch there. Surely there's a way to keep the most vulnerable part of our skin monitored and safe without such a conspicuous wearable. (Smart hats, anyone?)

The patch does seem a step up from the June wearable bracelet by  <a href="http://www.junebynetatmo.com/en-US/site">Netatmo</a> that also measures sun exposure through UV sensors.  It's been criticized by some reviewers for only providing measurable information in direct sunlight. And it can't be worn when swimming.

The UV patch only lasts for five days. Repeat applications could get expensive (the retail prices has not been released). It will be interesting to see how future versions compare.
<h2>Gemio Friendship Bracelet</h2>
<figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTM1NzE3OTM0ODQzNjExMTQ2-2.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>The <a href="http://www.gogemio.com/">Gemio friendship bracelet</a> is just the latest wearable pitched at the female teenage market. It contains rows of interchangeable “Gemsets” that can be snapped on and off. It's fitted with LED lights which can be used as a communication device with others who own them, flashing different light combinations that correlate to customized messages.

Gemio understands gestures, like a wave or a high five. The wearer can make it sparkle at the twist of your wrist make a light play when they wave hello.

Yet at a starting price of $100, i can't help thinking it's a little out of the reach of most young women. Yes, they have disposable cash, but will they want to spend quite so much on a communication trinket?

I'm a bigger fan of the slightly cheaper <a href="http://jewelbots.com/">Jewelbots</a>, which retail at $69. These are programmable friendship bracelets that teach girls the basics of coding. These also provide the functionality of assigning colors and light patterns to nearby friends wearing their own version but takes it up a notch as girls can plug in their charm and use its Arduino software extend the functionality of their charms. You can even find the open-source STL design files of earlier charm designs on <a href="https://github.com/Jewelbots/jewelbots-charms">GitHub</a>.
<h2>Welt</h2>
<figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTM1NzE4NjA3MDA2MDAzMTcw-2.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>The amusingly named <a href="http://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-to-showcase-three-creative-lab-projects-for-the-first-time-at-ces-2016">Welt</a> is a wearable belt—as opposed to the nonwearable kind, one supposes. Welt offers a discreet means for those interested in their health to monitor their waist size, eating habits and the number of steps taken, as well as their time spent sitting down. Sensors in the back of the belt buckle send data to an app for analysis, which results in the production of a range of personalized healthcare and weight-management plans.

It's nice to see a wearable move off the arm. It's also nice to see a health-focused wearable that caters to the less sporty. (It's not like anyone would wear a leather belt in the gym.)

It's also slightly better than the unfortunately named <a href="http://www.wearbelty.com/">Belty</a> of 2014 which was derided for its appearance. I'm just not sure the intended target market would purchase the belt.
<h2>Bartesan Home Cocktail Machine</h2>
<figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTM1NzE4OTcxNTQxMzUyNDE4-2.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>The Bartesan is a bit like a Keurig or Nespresso coffee-pod machine, but for cocktails. You buy the machine ($299), provide the liquor, and insert flavor capsules into the machine. After choosing your choice of cocktail and the amount of alcohol, the flavor capsule meets the alcohol and pretty soon, a cocktail is made.  The flavors come in $20 packs of 12 capsules, including Cosmopolitan, Uptown Rocks, Margarita, Bartesian Breeze, Sex On the Beach, and Zest Martini.

A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1384275386/bartesian-the-first-capsule-cocktail-machine/description">Kickstarter</a> campaign raised more than $100,000 and generated press. As a keen cocktail maker, I'm a little puzzled why people would buy this. You need to buy four different bottles of liquor. The machine costs a lot more than a blender. The flavors aren't cheap, and you do not have the option of being able to create your own flavors outside of those cocktail recipes programmed into the machine. That said, perhaps I'm not representative of their market audience.

I'm  a bigger fan perhaps of Picobrew, which some are calling "a 3D printer for beer." It's a DIY microbrewer that sits on your counter and enables you to brew beer using PicoPak ingredient kits produced by more than 50 of the world's most interesting craft breweries. It retails at $669. For that price, you also get a sous-vide function for meals.  PicoBrew also recently created a PicoBrew BrewMarketplace, which lets any brewer publish their beer ingredient combination and earn royalties on every sale. Could this be the programmable future of craft beer?
<h2>Pregnancy Pro</h2>
<figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTM1NzE5MzE5MTY1MjE3NDEx-2.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>Pregnancy tests are highly reliable and easy, even if they do involve the slightly undignified act of peeing on a stick. <a href="http://www.firstresponse.com/en">Pregnancy Pro</a> is described as the first pregnancy test that syncs with your smartphone and provides access to an app that offers information and support personalized to you. The consumer downloads the app, pees on the stick provided, and then gets personalized information about her fertility. Upon downloading the app, she can detail whether she's trying to get pregnant or not. That lets you avoid an awkward "congratulations" message.

I can't help feeling this is perhaps a scenario where the technology is extraneous. The pregnancy test, at $15, is double the cost of a standard test. I can think of better apps for tracking fertility like <a href="https://helloclue.com/">Clue </a>and even wearables like Bellabeat's <a href="https://www.bellabeat.com/">Leaf</a>, a health tracker that monitors activity levels, sleep quality, stress levels, ovulation, period, and contraception tracking as a cohesive whole.
<h2>Lessons For CES 2017</h2>
Cheap hardware and open-source software are making it easier to connect all manner of devices. What's still hard is coming up with an application that's actually useful. Is the thing that your device is replacing really broken—or are you stretching to find a reason to put technology somewhere where it's not useful?

It's not the processors, screens, and batteries on display at CES which limit technology. Those will get cheaper and better over time. It's the human ingenuity applied to them—and the time we've taken to get things right.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I talk to a lot of entrepreneurs and folks in the startup scene. When it comes to wearables, the one question I come back to again and again is, "What can this give me that my smartphone and laptop cannot?"&nbsp;</p><p>It's not a particularly sophisticated question, but it's a critical one. These devices tend to justify themselves as alternatives to reaching into a bag for a mobile phone.&nbsp;</p><p>Hand-based wearables—like bands, watches and jewellery—make up the primary wearables market at the moment. But as these gadgets get more advanced and become smaller, some developers are looking to take them beyond the upper extremities to other parts of the body. In fact, some of the most exciting and innovative developments are happening in products designed for the feet.&nbsp;</p><h2>"Back To The Future" Shoes</h2><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1MzE5MDAyNzExODg5MTcw.gif"><figcaption>Self-lacing Nike Mag Shoes</figcaption></figure><p>Nike&nbsp;took futuristic footwear out of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/">Back to the Future</a>&nbsp;and put it into prototype with the <a href="http://news.nike.com/news/nike-mag-2015">Nike Mag</a>, advancing&nbsp;what was coined the Nike Mag’s “power laces,” with digital technology. The result is an individually responsive system that senses the wearer’s motion to provide adaptive on-demand comfort and support. You can even check out a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcvbHJ1BZ9s">video of Michael J Fox trying them on</a>. &nbsp;With this kind of adaptive technology, it seems like the future has arrived.</p><h4>Digitsole's Smart Foot-Warming Technology</h4><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1NTM2ODQ1MDYzNzU1MDI2.png"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Anyone who has ever suffered from cold feet will be interested in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.digitsole.com/">Digitsole</a>,&nbsp;the first-ever connected, heated insole designed for athletes and&nbsp;anyone who gets cold feet. The temperature of the innersole&nbsp;is controlled via smartphone, which can also track calories and steps. I've tried it on, and it does indeed warm quite well, with a maximum temperature of&nbsp;113°F (45°C). It takes up to three minutes to heat and stay warm for up to 6 hours. The retail price is $199.</p><h2>GPS Smart Sole</h2><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1MzI1MTkwNjg2MDMzOTMw.jpg"><figcaption>Shoe embedded GPS tracking for nervous executives and the cognitively impaired.</figcaption></figure><p>The problem with wearables is that you have to remember to wear them. These GPS shoes inserts are designed to track people with cognitive conditions such as&nbsp;Alzheimer's, Dementia, Autism and traumatic brain injuries who may forget to wear a device.&nbsp;</p><p>Marketed to geriatric housing providers, adult children caring for parents and executives fearful of kidnapping,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gpssmartsole.com/">GPS Smart Sole</a> features a miniature embedded GPS tracking device and a rechargeable battery that lasts 2-3 days on a single charge. The device sends a signal to the central monitoring website, which shows the wearer's exact location.&nbsp;The retail price is $299 with additional payments required for a&nbsp;data plan.</p><h2>Shiftware Sneakers</h2><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1MzQ3NzIxNTQ3NTU3NTA3.gif"><figcaption>Change your shoes without removing your shoes</figcaption></figure><p>Not all wearables have to be functional. Some can just be creative for creative's sake.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.shiftwear.com/">Shiftware sneakers </a>offer the latest in bendable, wearable, waterproof HD displays, all in a pair of shoes featuring&nbsp;color e-paper displays in their sides. The wearer can use a corresponding app to display designs and animations, and even sell their designs through the app. The shoes aren't for general release but &nbsp;pre-launch prices started at $150.</p><h2>Rocket Skates&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1MzI1MDI2OTQwNDA1Nzcw.gif"><figcaption>Roller skating will never be the same.</figcaption></figure><p>Roller skating is no longer a pastime enjoyed only by small children and roller derby aficionados. <a href="http://www.actonglobal.com/">Rocket Skates</a>&nbsp;were launched launched at last year's CES, the world's first remote-free, strap-in, smart electric skates.</p><p>To start rolling, the wearer simply kicks off, tilting the skates forward to accelerate (up to a speed of 10 mph); the user tilts the skates backwards on the heels to apply the breaks. They come in a variety of styles, with retail price beginning at $499.&nbsp;</p><p>RocketSkates include a corresponding iOS and Android App app, and an open software development kit lets developers create custom apps, games, or integrate with other devices, such as watches or glasses.&nbsp;The skates look fun, but the price may be too much of a deterrent for, perhaps, anyone but the wealthy or the most devoted roller skaters—especially as the company admits they aren't easy to roll in.&nbsp;</p><h2>Quell Pain Relief&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1MzQ1NjczMzg1MDU2NzM0.jpg"><figcaption>Drug free pain relief through wearables.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The extensive testing and processes required for Food And Drug Administration clearance are significant barriers in the medical wearable market. Successfully crowdfunded last April, Quell is the only FDA-cleared, 100% drug-free wearable device clinically proven to relieve chronic pain.&nbsp;</p><p>The Quell device (which is actually designed for the leg, not the foot) sits in a sport band, with an electrode snapped onto the back of the device. The band then wraps around the upper calf, so the electrode maintains direct contact with the wearer's skin. The device stimulates the nerves in the upper calf, sending neural pulses to the brain and, supposedly, tapping into the body's natural pain relief response. Pre-calibrated quantities of endogenous opioids should then release into the spine, where pain signals are blocked in the body. A&nbsp;Quell Starter Kit and six-month supply of Quell Electrodes costs $398.75.&nbsp;</p><h2>Electricity-Generating Socks</h2><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM1MzQ4NjU0ODk3Njc4MzQ2.jpg"><figcaption>Urine operating wearables</figcaption></figure><p>This one sounds like something from an episode of a <a href="http://www.beargrylls.com/">Bear Grylls</a> TV show: A&nbsp;team of researchers from the University of West England has developed&nbsp;what it claims is the "first self-sufficient system powered by a wearable energy generator based on microbial fuel cell technology."&nbsp;</p><p>To be specific, it's&nbsp;a pair of socks that uses urine to generate electricity.&nbsp;</p><p>The team embedded soft&nbsp;microbial fuel cells (MFCs)&nbsp;into an ankle device and a pump into the heel of the sock. Walking around in the socks allows urine to circulate through integrated tubes that run toward the MFCs, which contain bacteria that guzzle nutrients and create electricity.</p><p>According to the researchers: &nbsp;</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p>"It is possible to envisage wearable transmission systems that have a purpose of transmitting a person's coordinates, in e.g. a case of emergency, which can operate when fed with just urine. A venture in this direction not only widens the range of applications that MFCs could be implemented in, but also introduces the concept of built-in 'proof of life' capability, since the device will only operate if the person wearing it, urinates inside it. This...may unlock further possibilities in outdoor gear, military equipment, operations at sea, as well as survival kits.</p></blockquote><p><br tml-linebreak="true">It's worth noting that a number of foot-focused wearables may one day be worn subcutaneously, especially for products like GPS tracking devices and pain management tools. Right now, foot-based wearables may not grab the public's attention as much as hand or head gear, but if the push toward development is any indication, they could be the way of the future.</p><p><em>Images courtesy of the respective companies listed</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Netscape <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/netscape-sets-source-code-free/">released its Web browser's source code to the public in 1998</a>, it seemed like a Hail Mary move for a company embattled by Microsoft.</p><p>Now barely a week goes by without a commercial tech company announcing the launch of a new platform, app or extension—and its source code. Among them is Microsoft, a company whose then-CEO, Steve Ballmer, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/">called the open-source Linux operating system a "cancer" in 2001</a>.</p><p>In the last year we've seen Apple release the code behind the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a> programming language; Google,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>, a machine-learning framework;&nbsp;Microsoft, a JavaScript <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/wiki/Roadmap">engine</a>;<em>&nbsp;</em>and Facebook, a plethora of open-source projects including<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://code.facebook.com/projects/450791118411445/react-native/">React Native</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">Relay</a>.</p><p>The emergence of companies like Facebook, Airbnb, and Square, whose businesses lie outside the world of commercial software, as players in open source is particularly interesting. While they may&nbsp;follow the <a href="http://opensource.org/docs/osd">principles</a> that&nbsp;underpin traditional open source software like <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux</a>,&nbsp;the reasons for their openness are not simply altruism and the greater good.</p><p>Releasing open source boosts their image as innovators, helping them recruit engineers. It also helps create de facto standards, as startups adopt their way of writing code. And in some cases, it may accelerate the development of entire industries.</p><p>Here are the big-picture trends that are driving open source forward in 2016—and beyond.</p><h2>Open Source Creates New Industries</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM1ODA5MDE2NjA0NDA0MzU1.jpg"><figcaption>Tesla Motors</figcaption></figure><p>In 2014, Tesla&nbsp;Motors, the electric-car maker,<a href="https://readwrite.com/2014/06/16/what-apple-should-learn-from-tesla">&nbsp;gave away its entire&nbsp;patent portfolio</a>, providing those using it promised not to engage in courtroom battles over intellectual property. While <a href="http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/02/general-motors-not-interested-in-open-tesla-patents/">General Motors rebuffed Tesla's offer</a>, the potential consequences of this are an increase in electric-car innovation across the automotive industry, meaning more electric cars, more infrastructure for them, and more consumers interested in buying them—including from Tesla.&nbsp;</p><h2>Open Source Will Make Machines Smarter</h2><p>Likewise, in <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.de/2015/11/tensorflow-smarter-machine-learning-for.html">November  Google  launched TensorFlow</a>, an <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">open-­source platform for machine learning</a>.&nbsp;TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team conducting machine learning and deep neural-networks research. The core is written in C++, but it has a Python front end.&nbsp;</p><p>By involving open-source enthusiasts, Google believes it will bring artificial intelligence closer to reality. Outsiders may expand the tool to other languages, including <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/08/googles-house-programming-language-now-runs-phones/">Go</a>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/09/the-second-coming-of-java/">Java</a>, and perhaps even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, so that coders have more ways of building AI-driven apps.&nbsp;</p><p>In a similar area, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and a team of experts in open machine learning recently announced the creation of a billion-dollar not-for-profit company artificial research company,&nbsp;<a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/">Open AI</a>:</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p> As a nonprofit, our aim is to build value for everyone rather than shareholders. Researchers will be strongly encouraged to publish their work, whether as papers, blog posts, or code, and our patents (if any) will be shared with the world. We'll freely collaborate with others across many institutions and expect to work with companies to research and deploy new technologies.</p></blockquote><p>Machine learning is a hard problem, made easier if advancements in the field are shared.</p><p>Open Source Makes Coders Happy&nbsp;</p><p>The altruistic notion of coders inspecting open source projects to fix bugs and add features dominates the image of open source. But reality is more complicated.</p><p>A programmer's GitHub page has become a de facto résumé. By contributing to open-source projects, a coder can show off her chops and impress recruiters and hiring managers—without the trouble of an awkward interview.</p><p>As Tom Preston-Werner, cofounder of GitHub, <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html">put it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>If you're hiring, the best technical interview possible is the one you don't have to do because the candidate is already kicking ass on one of your open source projects. Once technical excellence has been established in this way, all that remains is to verify cultural fit and convince that person to come work for you.</p></blockquote><p>It also has other professional and social benefits. One's open-source contributions instantly explain one's interests, serving as a calling card. Want to find a collaborator to work on a project? Just chat up someone who's building up the same codebase as you. For Alvaro Videla, contributing to RabbitMQ, an application messaging broker,&nbsp;<a href="http://videlalvaro.github.io/2014/08/on-contributing-to-opensource.html">led to writing a book and getting invited to speak at conferences</a>.</p><p>Open source isn't an unalloyed good. There are downsides for both coders and companies who participate in projects, which I'll address in future pieces. But it's clear that the powerful driving forces that have placed open source at the center of software innovation will continue throughout this year—and for years to come.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Netflix Throws Down The Gauntlet To VPN and Proxy Servers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Netflix announced <a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/evolving-proxy-detection-as-a-global-service">earlier this week&nbsp;</a>that&nbsp;any subscribers using a virtual private network (VPN), proxy, or "unblocker" service to access a version of Netflix that is not the one based in their country of location &nbsp;will be bounced over to their local service in the next few weeks.</p><p>The move comes just after Netflix announced it was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cnet.com/au/news/netflix-goes-live-in-130-new-countries/">launching service in 130 new countries</a>—a response to the massive&nbsp;international demand for the service fulfilled, so far, through the very services Netflix is now seeking to shut down.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a decision that will be felt keenly by those who wish to watch television shows and films outside of their region. Netflix may be an international brand, now, but most films and TV shows remain subject to regional licensing. That means, for example, that&nbsp;people living in the UK will not be able to watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1520211/"><em>The Walking Dead</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;people in Australia cannot watch <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3205802/">How To Get Away With Murder</a>.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Netflix’s terms of service haven’t changed. The company has long explicitly forbidden the use of mechanisms to bypass its software that detects a user's location, but it's never been strongly enforced up until now.&nbsp;Netflix admits:&nbsp;</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p>If all of our content were globally available, there wouldn’t be a reason for members to use proxies or “unblockers” to fool our systems into thinking they’re in a different country than they’re actually in. We are making progress in licensing content across the world and, as of last week, now offer the Netflix service in 190 countries, but we have a ways to go before we can offer people the same films and TV series everywhere.</p></blockquote><p>Expatriatess in particular, who are a cohort that regularly use VPNs for watching Netflix.&nbsp;I am an expat living in Germany where almost all international films and television are dubbed <em>auf Deutsch</em>. While I am happy to watch American films with German dubbing, despite my less-than-stellar language skills, &nbsp;it is nice to have the opportunity to watch the original version. (Musicals are particularly bizarre when dubbed.)&nbsp;</p><p>My friends think the same, even the German ones. One friend claimed that there are a small number of German actors who do all the voice overs so a lot of characters across the media sound the same. A Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/3czljq/do_most_germans_prefer_dubbed_movies_and_tv/ct0qwka">claimed</a> that the same voice actor subs in for both Bryan Cranston in <em>Breaking Bad</em> and Malcolm from <em>Malcolm In The Middle</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>I contacted a VPN provider for comment, who said his company "preferred to monitor the debate from the sideline" and asked not to be named.</p><p>Will the VPN services be able to bypass Netflix's new security maneuvers? Obviously they cannot encourage their subscribers to engage in what could be considered technically illegal acts. But if it turns out Netflix is targeting specific providers, then something like&nbsp;<a href="https://readwrite.com/2014/04/10/raspberry-pi-vpn-tutorial-server-secure-web-browsing">building your own Raspberry Pi VPN</a>&nbsp;server could come in handy, provided you don't mind shelling out a little money for hardware and spending some time coding. It will be far harder for Netflix to deal with a distributed army of VPNs than to crack down on specific, easily singled-out companies.</p><p>At least Netflix recognizes that people want to watch the same media all over. I suspect this move is more meant to appease the Hollywood studios that provide it with movies and shows. In the meantime, expect a cat-and-mouse game with VPNs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We haven't heard much from Path, a social app, since Korean Internet company Daum Kakao bought it last year. But a recent tweet caught our eye:</p>[embed]https://twitter.com/path/status/676989935547777024[/embed/<p><em></em>Path, which still has many users in Southeast Asia, has abandoned the Windows Phone platform. So, too, for that matter, has Microsoft. It is <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8913365/microsoft-lumia-windows-phones-strategy-2015">moving on from its transitional mobile operating system</a> to going all-in on Windows 10, which is meant to run on devices from traditional PCs to smartphones.</p><p>In the meantime, Microsoft has a problem: Developers are betting on iOS and Android, since that's where the mobile users are. Windows 10 smartphones are just now rolling out, and they're getting dinged for a lack of apps.</p><h2>A Bridge To Windows</h2><p>So Microsoft has been hard at work on solutions to get mobile developers to bring their existing code to Windows 10 without the need to write new apps from scratch on an unfamiliar platform. Its strategy: Create a series of “bridging” technologies to enable developers to bring their existing iOS, Android, Web, and desktop code and skill sets to the Windows Store, which is meant to be a universal app-delivery platform for desktop and mobile.</p><p>Microsoft first detailed the Windows bridge for iOS, formerly known as Project Islandwood, on the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/08/06/open-sourcing-the-windows-bridge-for-ios/">Windows blog in August 2015</a>, when it released it as an open-source "work in progress" toolkit for developers. Source code and instructions for the iOS bridge for Windows 10 were made available in <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC">GitHub</a>. </p><p>Now Microsoft has announced it will soon release a <a href="https://dev.windows.com/en-us/bridges/ios/app-submission">Web tool</a> that will:</p><blockquote><p>"... automatically analyze your app for compatibility with the bridge and give you results right in your browser. You’ll be able to see exactly how much work you’ll have to do to bring your app to Windows, along with suggestions, tips and workarounds for any libraries you’re using that the bridge doesn’t support yet."</p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM1OTcyMzc0MzQzMzU3NzE0.png"></figure><p>Microsoft is still struggling to build some of its bridges. In November, the <a href="http://tempest.saymedia.com/Microsoft%20also%20developed%20a%20Web%20bridge%20for%20Windows%2010%20(%22Westminster%22)%20and%20is%20working%20on%20a%20bridge%20to%20help%20developers%20package%20and%20publish%20existing%20.NET%20and%20Win32%20apps%20to%20the%20Windows%20Store%20(%22Centennial%22).%20Microsoft%20partner%20Mobilize.Net%20also%20developed%20a%20bridge%20to%20help%20Windows%20Phone%20Silverlight%20apps%20to%20the%20Universal%20Web%20Apps%20platform.">Android bridge</a>, also known as<em> </em>Project Astoria, was apparently<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/microsoft_confirms_that_android_app_support_in_windows_10_is_on_hold-news-15053.php"> put on hold</a>. </p><p>In better shape are a Web bridge for Windows 10, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/07/06/project-westminster-in-a-nutshell/">Project Westminster</a>, as well as bridges for its existing developers writing .NET and Win32 apps (<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/08/06/open-sourcing-the-windows-bridge-for-ios/">Project Centennial</a>), with public testing sometime this year.</p><p>The irony is that for much of the '90s and the early 2000s, Windows was the build-first platform, and other operating systems had to build porting tools, like the Windows-to-Linux Mono project. Now the shoe is on the other foot—and Microsoft is finding that porting is a hard task, indeed.</p><p><em>Photo by <a href="http://freestock.ca/wishing_well_%e2%98%85_g103-golden_love_bridge__hdr_%e2%98%85_p5040.html">Nicolas Raymond</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Smart Homes Need Smarter Apps</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Consumers are frustrated with smart homes. Notably, they're not annoyed with the devices that wire up their living environments. It's the apps through which they schedule and manage each device, according to a new report from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.argusinsights.com/">Argus Insights</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Argus, notably, uses actual data drawn from devices and public sources like app-store reviews. In this case, it analyzed 50,000 smart-home device and app reviews from August 2015 to the present. Researchers&nbsp;found that&nbsp;there is a profound disconnect between how consumers perceive the hardware and software produced by several major smart-home brands.</p><p>Industry stalwart <a href="https://readwrite.com/2014/06/11/honeywell-and-vivints-new-smart-home-platforms-openness-is-overrated">Honeywell's</a> apps received the best ratings despite their low-rated devices. By comparison, apps from&nbsp;<a href="https://readwrite.com/2014/03/31/smart-lightbulbs-smart-home-philips-hue-lg-samsung">Philip&nbsp;</a>apps were considered the least satisfactory, though their physical products faired better.</p><h2>A Slow App Is Not Smart</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2MTMzMTgwMzM0ODExNzc5.png"></figure><p>Users &nbsp;often complained of “major delays” and generally “slow” and “unresponsive” interfaces.&nbsp;One major pain point persists around video streaming, with reports of videos going “black every few seconds” and “extremely long” load times when attempting to view content through applications.&nbsp;</p><p>One big reason for dissatisfaction is that consumers don't have a choice in most cases: In order to use the device, they're forced to download the manufacturer's app. This is a big argument in support of <a href="https://readwrite.com/2014/09/23/wink-relay-touchscreen-wall-panel">smart-home hub developers like Wink</a>. Wink CTO Nathan Smith recently told ReadWrite that Wink is deemphasizing its physical touchscreen hub in favor of its apps that can handle many major smart-home brands, and its recently announced support for Amazon Echo.</p><h2>Make Better Apps—Or Get Out Of The Way</h2><p>There is an inherent bias to data drawn from consumer-posted reviews, as consumers are more likely to post reviews of products when they experience problems. Yet two things stand out from the report:</p><ul><li>Consumers are resigned, not receptive, to using apps to manage their smart-home devices. Manufacturers have largely failed to create captivating experiences.</li><li>Overall, most app experiences fail to match up with that of the hardware devices.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This study is a wake-up call to companies in the smart-home space: You can't think of yourself as just a hardware company anymore. You're an app developer, too.</p><p>And if you discover you're not a very good app developer? Then you'd be best off opening up an API and letting others build better apps for you.</p><p><em>Screenshot via Marvel Studios</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

It  provides drag-and-drop widgets that let the developer easily visualize real-time and historical data and  triggers that allow a sensor, motor, or actuator to invoke an action on another device. There are also threshold alerts that send emails or SMS messages based on customizable criteria, and provisions for scheduling specific days and times when lights, motors, valves, and actuators turn on and off.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2MTMzOTk5ODY4Mjk5Mjc0.png"></figure><p>“It is like an easy-to-use website builder but for IoT projects,” Bromber said.</p><p>Cayenne's support for&nbsp;<a href="https://readwrite.com/2014/11/10/raspberry-pi-releases-model-a-plus">Raspberry Pi</a>&nbsp;could make it popular with tinkerers who like that cheap hardware platform for simple projects and prototypes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Popular navigation app Waze has introduced a transport SDK (software development kit) to enable third party developers to integrate Waze features into their own apps. Waze is a community-based traffic and navigation app that is owned by Google and services over 50 million consumers.</p><p>The SDK is capable of supporting partners in countries where Waze has a presence and will be open to all types of partners including such as food delivery, taxis and valet parking. The first set of partners announced are <a href="https://lyft.com/">Lyft</a>, <a href="http://genesispulse.com/">Genesis Pulse</a>,<a href="https://www.justpark.com/">JustPark</a>, <a href="https://cornershopapp.com/">Cornershop</a>, <a href="http://www.cabify.es/es/home">Cabify</a> and <a href="http://www.99taxis.com/">99Taxis</a>. Using the SDK, the partner will be able to utilize Waze’s ETA, turn-by-turn navigation and choice of routing, all while reducing the friction of having to swap between apps - a common complaint amongst professional drivers.</p><p>Waze says that this new development is a win for the partners, service users, and the whole Waze community. Partners will be able to use the transport sdk to grow their business and build new features that will make their apps even better. Service users will appreciate fast and efficient transport routes. The extended community will benefit from the addition of thousands of drivers which will improve the Waze map and feed more data back into Waze.<br tml-linebreak="true"><br tml-linebreak="true">The API is free but currently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/22/google-ventures-puts-258m-into-uber-its-largest-deal-ever/">invite-only</a>. As partners increase, Waze can only benefit from their data and engagement.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>IBM Launches A Cloud Data And Analytics Marketplace For Developers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are certain topics in B2B technology that have staying power. &nbsp;Cloud computing and big data are two of these.&nbsp;IBM&nbsp;today announced a broad expansion of its <a href="http://www.ibm.biz/open-for-data">Cloud Data Services</a> portfolio with more than 25 services now available to developers and data scientists.These create a&nbsp;one-stop-shop for accessing and exploring data and for building and deploying applications.&nbsp;They can help developers build, deploy and manage web and mobile applications and also enable data scientists to discover hidden trends using data and analytics in the cloud.&nbsp;</p><p>In line with the recent trend of commercial tech companies <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/01/19/open-source-future">embracing the open source ethos</a> (or at least components of it), these hybrid cloud services can be deployed across multiple cloud providers and are based on open source technologies, open ecosystems that include company and third-party data, and open architectures that allows data to easily flow amongst the different services.&nbsp;</p><p>IBM's new cloud services include:</p><ul><li><strong>IBM Compose Enterprise:</strong> A managed platform designed to help development teams build modern web-scale apps faster by enabling them to deploy business-ready open source databases in minutes on their own dedicated cloud servers.</li><li><strong>IBM Graph:</strong> The first fully managed graph database service built on Apache<em>®</em> TinkerPop that provides developers a complete stack for extending business-ready apps with real-time recommendations, fraud detection, IoT and network analysis uses.</li><li><strong>IBM Predictive Analytics:</strong> A service that allows developers to easily self-build machine learning models from a broad library into applications to help deliver predictions for specific product use cases, without the help of a data scientist.<strong></strong></li><li><strong>IBM Analytics Exchange:</strong> An open data exchange that includes a catalog of more than 150 publicly available datasets that can be used for analysis or integrated into applications.</li></ul><p>IBM’s open approach means that any member of a data team can add or remove services at any time, to best suit immediate and long-term needs of their business. Developers can tap IBM Cloud Data Services to openly and freely move data in, across and out of the services.</p><p>Derek Schoettle, General Manager, Analytics Platform and Cloud Data Services considers IBM's cloud data services to be a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/4/10906882/gear-vr-altspacevr-social-virtual-world-launch">'one-stop-shop'</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;data and analytics services, cloud development platform <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/?lnk=fif">Bluemix</a>;&nbsp;and Analytics Exchange, a&nbsp;repository of more than 150 public and free data sources, everything from census data to government economics statistics.&nbsp;</p><p>He claims the&nbsp;key beneficiaries of cloud data services is the citizen analyst who can enjoy a 'drag and drop experience' without enlisting the help of the IT department. Clearly IBM is intent on embracing business solutions that bring data analysis to the workplace.&nbsp;</p><p>Predictably, IBM has kept its finger in the AI pie with the release of&nbsp;Predictive Analytics, a complementary service to&nbsp;Apache Spark, that&nbsp;makes it easier for app developers to build their own machine learning models based on product use cases. The developer can define the use case, provide the data set to base the model on, and the Predictive Analytics service will evaluate a set of algorithms to determine which one will provide the most accurate predictions. This makes AI exploration quite accessible to the budding scientist.&nbsp;</p><p>While IBM has a slew of competitors to deal with, they are clearly in this for the long haul, and it will be interesting to see how their new services are received by consumers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>IoT Security Concerns Show An Industry Struggling To Keep Up</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The growth of the Internet of Things  has been predicted over the last few years and has led to a plethora of connected devices. Household devices have led the charge with smart thermostats, refrigerators, and washing machines. We have seen security devices like home security cameras and baby monitors, and health devices like insulin pumps and pacemakers. And we all know about wearables like fitness trackers and watches.

It's hardly surprising to read that concerns about device security have been raised, often in the same breath as the announcements celebrating the new technology. The latest  gadget to fall under scrutiny is Internet-connected baby monitors, with parents up in arms after discovering that the devices are easily hackable.

There's been a number of  reported cases of parents discovering hackers watching and talking to their children at night, and last week New York City Department of Consumer Affairs launched an investigation into the security of baby monitors, issuing <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hack-alert-nyc-regulators-warn-parents-secure-their-baby-monitors-n505391">subpoenas to four manufacturers of baby video monitors </a>as part of an investigation into the security vulnerabilities of the devices. The  <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/your-baby-monitor-secure">Federal Trade Commission</a> has followed suit with a page of <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/your-baby-monitor-secure">warnings</a> on their website.

However, reports of baby monitor hacking are not something new, with security issues being raised <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/10/baby-monitor-hacking/">as early as 2013</a>. News reports have pointed fingers at <a href="https://www.shodan.io/">Shodan</a>, a search engine launched in 2013 which can be used to find Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices around the world. Shodan scours the Web for devices which use Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP port 554) which are left open without basic password protection -- or only the default password settings -- in place, taking a photograph of what an be seen.

But historically, there are plenty of devices without cameras that are vulnerable to attack from the <a href="http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2287192/defcon-hackers-release-ford-and-toyota-car-hijack-data">Toyota Prius</a> to<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/27/fatal_insulin_pump_attack/"> insulin pumps</a> to <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/blog/new-wi-fi-kettle-same-old-security-issues-meh/">wifi kettles</a>, although admittedly some are hacked as demonstrations into the ability to do so rather than with malice, it's still sobering stuff.
<h2>Who's responsible: manufacturer or consumer?</h2>
It's not unreasonable to believe that a person who buys a connected device and utilizes it according to the manufacturer's instructions has a right to privacy, security and a relatively hack-free existence. But this comes with the expectation that a consumer will update and install security patches. Bear in mind that most people don't even read the terms and conditions <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/15/i-read-all-the-small-print-on-the-internet">when they download an app</a> or <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/29/londoners-wi-fi-security-herod-clause">install free wifi in a public space</a>, let alone install a home security device or baby monitor.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-staff-report-november-2013-workshop-entitled-internet-things-privacy/150127iotrpt.pdf?_ga=1.47104549.344034108.1452451014">report</a> into IoT privacy and security in early 2015 which detailed the issues and issues a series of recommendations for companies developing IoT devices. These included:
<ul>
 	<li>build security into devices at the outset, rather than as an afterthought in the design process;</li>
 	<li>when a security risk is identified, consider a “defense-in-depth” strategy whereby multiple layers of security may be used to defend against a particular risk;</li>
 	<li>consider measures to keep unauthorized users from accessing a consumer’s device, data, or personal information stored on the network;</li>
 	<li>monitor connected devices throughout their expected life cycle, and where feasible, provide security patches to cover known risks.</li>
</ul>
The last point is particularly interesting, with the onus on developers to monitor connected devices. How often and to what extent is not clear.

The report also suggested ways of educating consumers including video tutorials, affixing QR codes on devices, and providing choices at point-of-sale, within set-up wizards, or in a privacy dashboard.

It's worth noting, however, that the report concerned data gathered through meetings 18 months prior to its release. Technology moves fast and recommendations, however commendable, may lack the required impetus to create industry change.
<h2>What is the legal precedent?</h2>
Several of these principles alluded in the FTC report are illustrated by the Commission’s first case involving an Internet-connected device. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/09/marketer-internet-connected-home-security-video-cameras-settles">FTC filed a complaint against security camera maker TrendNet</a> for allegedly misrepresenting its software as "secure." In its <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/140207trendnetcmpt.pdf">complaint,</a> the Commission alleged, among other things, that the company transmitted user login credentials in clear text over the Internet, stored login credentials in clear text on users’ mobile devices, and failed to test consumers’ privacy settings to ensure that video feeds marked as “private” would, in fact, e private.

As a result of these alleged failures, hackers were able to access live feeds from consumers’ security cameras and conduct “unauthorized surveillance of infants sleeping in their cribs, young children playing, and adults engaging in typical daily activities.The complaint came after hackers breached TrendNet's Web site and accessed videos from 700 users' live-camera feeds -- many of these videos were published on the Internet.

The case was settled with stipulations including requiring the company to obtain third-party assessments of its security programs every two years for the next 20 years. TrendNet were also required to notify customers about the security issues with the cameras and the availability of the software update to correct them, and to provide customers with free technical support for the next two years to assist them in updating or uninstalling their cameras.
<h3>Legislation to Protect Drivers from Auto Security and Privacy Vulnerabilities</h3>
In July 2015 Senator Ed Markey introduced the <a href="http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SPY%20Car%20legislation.pdf"><em>Security and Privacy in Your Car (SPY Car) Ac</em><em>t</em></a>, legislation that would direct NHTSA and the Federal Trade Commission to establish federal standards to secure our cars and protect drivers’ privacy. The SPY Car Act also establishes a rating system — or “cyber dashboard”— that informs consumers about how well the vehicle protects drivers’ security and privacy beyond those minimum standards. Some of the specifics:
<ul>
 	<li>Requirement that all wireless access points in the car are protected against hacking attacks, evaluated using penetration testing;</li>
 	<li>Requirement that all collected information is appropriately secured and encrypted to prevent unwanted access; and;</li>
 	<li>Requirement that the manufacturer or third-party feature provider be able to detect, report and respond to real-time hacking events.</li>
</ul>
Security of IoT devices degrades rapidly. Whilst protection should be present in every stage of development, new vulnerabilities can easily appear and IoT devices that were once considered adequately secure may no longer be trusted. But security has always been a part of modern life, as has meeting the needs of consumers. Consumers won't stay ignorant for long thanks to renewed media attention. Without regulation and consumer pressure to require companies to act, it is unlikely that technology companies will provide 'term of life' protection for consumers.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Valentine's Day is almost upon us, the time when couples make up for a year of passive aggression in a single evening. You're obviously intelligent. You don't just do red roses and chocolates. It's the worst evening to book a restaurant dinner. Here are some more interesting (but SFW) options to keep the romance alive.</p><h2>Pillow Talk</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2NDc5MzI4MTIzNzU4MTc3.jpg"></figure><p><a href="http://www.littleriot.com/pillow-talk/">Pillow Talk</a> brings back the intimacy to long-distance relationships through the use of a wristband that picks up your heartbeat and sends it, in real time, to your loved one. They can listen to your heartbeat in your pillow and they can hear yours. </p><p>It's the brainchild of  UK entrepreneur Joanna Montgomery</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p>"It's amazing that we can constantly message each other on smart phones, or sit on video calls, but why shouldn't we be able to feel connected to our loved ones? We made Pillow Talk because emoticons and pixelated video calls just don't really cut it."</p></blockquote><h2>The Hug Shirt</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2NDc5OTQ2ODY3NDg0MjU1.jpg"></figure><p>The <a href="http://cutecircuit.com/the-hug-shirt/">HugShirt</a> was invented by Francesca Rosella and Ryan Genz, the co-founders of wearables fashion house CuteCircuit.The shirt is embedded with sensors that feel the strength, duration, and location of the touch, the skin warmth and the heartbeat rate of the sender and actuators that recreate the sensation of touch, warmth and emotion of the hug to the Hug Shirt of the distant loved one. The Hug Shirt records a hug like you would record a movie and delivers the data to your mobile via Bluetooth through the app and then your hug is transmitted over the network to your partner's phone and it is seamlessly transmitted via Bluetooth to their Hug Shirt. </p><h2>Happy Couple</h2><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM2NDc4ODI4Mjk2OTM5MTA1.webp"></figure><p>Happy Couple is a great quiz style app for getting to know your partner better and facilitating greater communication between you and your loved one. It's the brainchild of CEO and founder Julien Robert who I had the pleasure of meeting last year in Helsinki. The game originated after Julien's efforts in "applying start-up principles to my own relationship" and really his own story is classic romance for tech entrepreneurs: French Julien (serial entrepreneur) met his American girlfriend Erin Johnson (former Google employee) on Tinder while living in San Francisco. They moved in a month later and their relationship has survived the challenge of visa restrictions, long-distance loving as they now happily reside together in Berlin.</p><p>Unlike other start-ups, the team includes cofounder Dr. Lonnie Barbach, a couple’s therapist and author of international best-sellers on sex and relationships. She brings this expertise to the game’s content," Robert says. The game's development including plenty of research including hundreds of couples being interviewed on their relationships and being sent weekly surveys for six months. It's a neat combination of gamification and "deep and meaningful" content, including a quiz-style game and daily tips and challenges. Last weekend it hit the number one spot on French health and fitness chart for iPhone. </p><h2>Kissenger</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2NDc5NzQyODU2NTM3Njk1.jpg"></figure><p><a href="http://www.kissengers.com/">Kissenger</a> is possibly the weirdest connected device I've seen yet. It's what the company likes to call "embodied emotional communication hardware." The idea is that you kiss away on your Kissinger and the touch-sensitive device sends the movements to another Kissinger held by your distant loved one. That Kissinger moves its own lips in response. The lips are made from silicone and the kissing critter makes a sort of buzzing noise when it replicates a smooch. I've heard it described as "a bit like kissing a vibrator."  If you're not sure what I'm actually talking about or just want to know more, I'd encourage you to check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV4bUplyOIQ">video</a> for a giggle. It could be worse, the original prototype featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSckuNlzQdM">a cow and a rabbit</a>. </p><h2>Eternity Wall</h2><p>Want to make your message last forever? Whilst there's a certain romance in carving your initials in a tree or naming a star after your beloved, another way to declare your  love is to embed in the block chain.  <a href="http://eternitywall.it/">Eternity Wall</a> is  a ledger of messages  embedded in the blockchain. There are over 5 thousands copies of this ledger all around the world and soon it will also be in space. Even if this site goes down or disappears, your message is guaranteed to persist for generations to come.</p><h2>Klikaklu</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2NDg0NTA4NjU5NjIzNTIx.jpg"></figure><p>The awkwardly phonetically named <a href="http://www.klikaklu.com/">Klikaklu</a> app enables you to create a fun treasure hunt or geocaching event for your partner without too much hard work. Include fun places you've spent time together, some thoughtful clues and small gifts and end it with a romantic picnic or dinner for two at featuring their favorite cuisine. </p><h2>Single  And Looking For Love?</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2NDc5NDY1NTYyNzExNjQ3.jpg"></figure><p>My friends tell me how hard it is being single in the age of Tinder. All that time getting your hopes up for someone who is flaky or unavailable...For those still looking for love, app <a href="http://joinwhim.com/">Whim</a> cuts to the chase and sets up actual dates avoiding the risk of endless texting without ever meeting. Users plug in when they’re free, who they like on the app, and when Whim finds two mutually interested daters it arranges the meet. Only when users are set up for a date in a mutually agreed upon time and place are they able to chat. Creator Eve Peters formerly worked for OkCupid.</p><p>Less painful that a 'bring a single friend' party, dating app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hinge/id595287172?mt=8">Hinge </a>matches only users who share Facebook friends. Every day at noon, the app sends a list of potential matches culled from one’s Facebook network. </p><h2>Even Functional Tech Can Be Romantic</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2NDg1MDQzOTE5OTIyNzgz.jpg"></figure><p>Are you wondering what I might like for Valentine's Day? As some of you might know, I'm Australian and I live in Germany. Neither are countries where Valentine's Day is celebrated to any extent. </p><p>I attracted a look of horror from my husband when I said my dream Valentine's Day gift was a Roomba. Vacuuming is my most loathed cleaning task and the notion that a robot could do it for me (perhaps even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4XB2wZqF4">with the cat sitting on it</a>, the cause of the need for vacuuming in the first place) is very pleasing. </p><p>Seriously, even the most functional of gadgets can be romantic if its presented in the right way. A mobile that's already been set up with lots of notes and photos. A camera full of happy snaps. A kindle full of love poems and books by the recipient's favorite authors. Include a <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/176874265/romantic-card-valentine-card-iphone-card?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=there%20is%20no%20one%20i%27d%20rather%20lie%20in%20bed%20and%20look%20at%20my%20phone%20next%20to&amp;ref=sr_gallery_1">thoughtful card</a> with the gift.And if you get it wrong, don't worry you've got 364 days of being reminded of it to get it right for next year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Cisco Acquires Jasper:</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cisco announced recently that it was buying Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion. Jasper's IoT platform enables thousands of companies to launch, manage and monetize IoT services on a global scale. They specialize in managing the wireless connections and billing relationships with the cellular carriers needed for IoT applications.</p><p>Jasper has a broad geographic reach of more than 3,500 customers in more than 100 countries. They currently partner with 27 mobile operator groups, representing more than 100 mobile operator networks worldwide. Their technology is present in a diverse range of applications. It enables drivers to remotely unlock doors, start the engine or call emergency roadside assistance in cars from Ford and Nissan. Amazon Kindle readers can get e-books delivered over the Internet through its software. Heineken NV uses it to monitor beer quality and keg levels. General Electric Co. jet engines connected via Jasper technology deliver performance data to maintenance engineers on the ground, reducing costs.</p><p>I spoke to Macario Namie, Jasper's VP of strategy, about the acquisition and was interested in how he thought it would benefit Jasper</p><p>"They have assets, funding, product portfolio and frankly, they believe in us and want to support the vision of what we want to achieve," said Namie. "We want to be the winner in IoT and this will help really make this happen in what is arguably the next generation of the Internet. "</p><p>He emphasized that they would continue to operate as a standalone team as part of Cisco’s new IoT business unit. "They are buying the Jasper team, all of us are coming over to form a dedicated business unit, and will take our current business and continue to perform well at it and accelerate our vision of what it takes to build connected services and businesses"</p><p>I was curious about if there were any concerns as Cisco has an interesting history in acquiring innovative businesses. Cisco has bought over 140 companies including forty-one during 1999-2000. Some acquisitions have been highly successful while others have failed.&nbsp;</p><p>Cisco acquired Monterey Networks for half a billion dollars in 1999. Within days of the deal, all three of Monterey’s founders left the company and eighteen months later Cisco shut down the business altogether, taking $108 million in write-offs.</p><p>Linksys was acquired in 2003 for a deal valued half a billion dollars. It was to be operated as an autonomous division of Cisco, its products sold under the Linksys brand through its existing retail, distributor and e-commerce channels and was a move into the home networking consumer market. 10 years later it was sold to Belkin.&nbsp;</p><p>Cisco bought Pure Digital Technologies, maker of the Flip video cameras in 2008 for $590 million. While it could be considered an effort to complement its consumer electronics portfolio, it seemed a bit incongruous compared to its core enterprise networking focus. Two years later, it closed Flip's business unit and cut 550 employees.</p><p>"There's always a nagging concern, can the magic still remain," admit Namie, "A lot of times it doesn’t work but what gives me a lot of hope here of a successful acquisition is our standalone team The general manager will be the current Jasper founder. We will have our own engineering team, marketing, and sales. The magic that's created today will remain. So much of the world's internet traffic runs on Cisco. We layer onto what they’ve already done with a software model and a recurring revenue model."&nbsp;</p><p>The acquisition on paper reads as a mutual win  for both Jasper and Cisco. Cisco will continue to build upon the Jasper IoT service platform and add new IoT services such as enterprise Wi-Fi, security for connected devices, and advanced analytics to better manage device usage. Jasper will have increased scope from the funding and a shared vision. Both companies are currently in transition, waiting for regulatory approval and are looking to join forces in by early April. Whether the companies can create a lasting, beneficial symbiotic relationship will be interesting to see.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Firechat adopts Ant Wireless</title>
		<link>https://readwrite.com/2016/02/16/open-garden-gets-ant/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://opengarden.com/home/">&nbsp;Open Garden </a>&nbsp;is adopting ANT wireless technology, which will be available in the new release of its flagship mobile app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id719829352?mt=8&amp;&amp;referrer=click%3Dd90f39c8-c18e-44ee-a7cd-56ffe7267c38">FireChat</a>. FireChat is the first “off the grid” mobile app that enables people to communicate for free, even if they do not have access to the Internet, a cellular network, or a data plan.</p><p>FireChat allows people and communities to create their own free communications networks thanks to its unique peer-to-peer mesh networking technology. In order to significantly enhance direct connections between Android smartphones, FireChat now uses the ANT protocol, in addition to Bluetooth and peer-to-peer WiFi, to let smartphones connect to each other to exchange messages and photos when offline. </p><p>With this technology, people &nbsp;don't need a phone signal or Internet connection to send or download messages -- instead, it connects phones using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radio signals as long as they are no more than 200 feet apart. If just five percent of phones in a city use the app, the company says, then messages can travel through the mesh of off-the-grid phones to cross the entire city within a few minutes.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.thisisant.com">ANT</a> is an ultra low power (ULP) wireless networking protocol that enables direct connections between devices and can be found in everything from fitness sensors to apps and consumer devices, including over 200 million mobile devices.</p><p>Christophe Daligault, CMO of Open Garden sees Firechat as an enabler for mobile communication in most countries where people can barely afford to buy a smartphone, let alone a data plan or credits.&nbsp;</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p>"Unsurprisingly, more and more people are using FireChat in countries such as India, Malaysia, Mexico, and the Philippines. To enable free communications in these countries, robust direct connectivity between Android mobile devices is critical. This is precisely what ANT helps us accomplish.”</p></blockquote><p>The app has been used extensively in countries <a href="https://readwrite.com/2014/09/29/firechat-hong-kong-protests">when governments threaten to shut down cellular wifi </a>such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Iraq, and Russia.&nbsp;It also has great implications for situations when conventional communication is down due to events such as severe storms or earthquakes and is also useful in situations like crowded concerts and sporting events.&nbsp;</p><p>Off the grid technology is not new but it has been limited to a lack of range. The adoption of ANT wireless technology by Open Garden will take the concept further than before and this is an innovation that is definitely one to watch.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Zapier Introduces Multi-Step Zaps</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2NDU5MDkwNTA2Mjk0ODgx.png"></figure><p>This month Zapier announced their new Multi-Step Zaps. If you're not already familiar with Zapier, it's a handy automation platform which  syncs apps (a process they call zaps), enabling them to talk to each other and thus perform actions without the need for programming. This could be as simple as a notification in Slack when your company’s name is mentioned on Twitter or an automated addition of  PayPal customers emails to a mail chimp list when they make a purchase in your online store. The 5oo apps available across the spectrum of project management, ecommerce, customer relations and social media including Asana, Freshbooks, Buffer, GitHub and SugarSync&nbsp;</p><p>The latest announcement lets users chain as many Actions as desired to a single Trigger. You're no longer limited to one-to-one connections. You can even mix-and-match data from multiple apps to pass all the essentials to a dedicated hub, like routing all customer information from emails and forms into your CRM or tracking spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p><p>With a workforce that has almost doubled to 36 in the last year, Zapier is a remote team of specialist staff working across the globe. I spoke to Danny Schreiber, Marketer at Zapier about the company's new capabilities and the challenges that result.  Zapier's early days saw 50 apps available through their automation services. a number which has now grown to over 500. Danny admits that this has not been without its challenges especially if service goes down on a single app.  "Now a third of our term are customer support and we employ 20 engineers to ensure that the service is reliable, easy to use and we’ll be there if something goes wrong".&nbsp;</p><p>He admits that there's a veritable wish list of apps that customers really want to app to Zapier, "Oracle, Excel and Microsoft dynamics, these integrations are more complex and require more testing and more quality assurance". They also are hoping to enable team accounts for workplace departments in the new future as Danny notes "Hundreds of people are asking for this feature and we are working hard to make it happen"</p><p>For those wanting to crank it up a notch, Zapier has also enabled  Code integration to let customers  write simple code for tasking like formatting names and email addresses and converting date formats to be relevant to the requirements of different countries.</p><p>The future can only be bright for Zapier as Danny predicts "I think we'll have more than 1000 apps by 2017".</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/tweets-on-twitter-is-in-serious-decline-2016-2?r=UK&amp;IR=T">Reports this week</a> suggest that the number of tweets per day created by Twitter's users has fallen by more than half since a peak in August 2014, according to a sampling of data from Twitter's API. It's hardly surprising, as both the media and tech sector have been charting and predicting its downward trajectory for several years. This is in addition to <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/06/12/twitter-ceo-dick-costolo-resigns/">hits on the stock exchange </a>in 2014, a <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/06/11/twitter-costolo-dorsey/">change of CEO</a> in 2015, the debacle regarding the<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/Starbird_iConference2014-final.pdf"> identity 2013 of Boston Marathon bomber</a>, and persistent reports of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/08/twitter-bullies-voice-responsibility-caroline-criado-perez">bullying via twitter</a> from the general public, politicians and celebrities. </p><p>Whatever statistical or financial report you choose to read, it's a sobering lesson for those creating new technology. An analysis of Twitter so far can provide something of a cautionary tales for those working in new media, wearables, IoT or any of the new technologies that are currently being developed. It demonstrates the importance of nurturing not only your product but also the ecosystem that surrounds it. </p><h2><strong>Your (Perceived) Changes May Work To Your Advantage</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2NDgzODEzNjgwMjI3OTM3.jpg"></figure><p>The #RIPTwitter debacle may be a blessing in disguise. The hashtag hit the social media on Saturday after an article <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/twitter-to-introduce-algorithmic-timeline-as-soon-as-next-we?utm_term=.okYwordBK#.si1v189Mx">from Buzzfeed</a>&nbsp;stating that Twitter would soon prioritise the Tweets that appear on a user's timeline based on algorithms. Essentially, under the reported new system, you'd see Tweets that Twitter thinks you'd like, rather than in the current reverse-chronological order similar to how posts on Facebook timelines are organized</p><p>It's the most attention Twitter has received from its users in a while and shows the need to keep communicating with your audience or customers. That Jack Dorsey chose to correct the misinformation with some immediacy, on a weekend to boot, also wins him extra brownie points. </p><h2><strong>Take Ownership Of Your Complaints But Also, Look At The Flipside</strong></h2><p>I've heard Twitter called a 'shouting gallery' of noisy spambots, celebrity gossip, and trolls, devoid of real interactive communication. People talk about feeling lonely on Twitter. However the flipside of this noise and attention is apparent in the success of live twitter feeds for political debates, sporting events like <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2016/how-the-broncos-sb50-victory-played-out-live-on-twitter">The SuperBowl</a>, and the sheer pleasure in following an amusing hashtag discussion.</p><p>Curated experiences like hashtag following have more resonance than an everyday newsfeed where it's easy to lose the flow. Twitter could optimise on this strength through providing a range of options for a curated experience. These could include easier mechanisms to view and edit those followed, a "more like this" API,  the option for breakout topics in a separate tab and a 'read later' API for news links, to name but a few ideas. </p><p>People are still talking in Twitter and sharing thoughts and opinions but in a different way.  In facilitating these kinds of opportunities, Twitter would be building on some of their strengths while staying true to the core goals of facilitating succinct communication amongst account holders. </p><h2><strong>Don't Just Let Them Talk, Make Sure You Listen</strong></h2><p>As a platform, Twitter has controlled its users from the get go, from the length of tweets to the number of accounts that can be followed, to the facilitation of abbreviations and hashtags. It has not only shaped how people use the platform but also their expectations of it.</p><p>Where it has failed is a lack of listening - listening to account holders and what they want and most importantly, engaging with not only people with inactive accounts but those who have closed their accounts. Why aren't they asking people to rate their experiences and offer recommendations? Why are  they failing to respond to opportunities to get meaningful data? Every person that registers an account but uses it only rarely or deletes their account is a lost opportunity if there is no engagement. </p><h2><strong>Consider Abuse Over The Entire Lifecycle Of Your Product</strong></h2><p>Twitter has been long accused of <a href="https://readwrite.com/2014/07/29/twitter-harassment-askcostolo-ignores">failing to take abuse</a> on the social network seriously. Even then CEO Dick Costolo recognized the epidemic and admitted: "We suck at dealing with abuse." </p><p>Twitter created a partnership with the nonprofit Women, Action &amp; the Media (WAM!) in 2014 to address issues of online bullying and harassment. Twitter granted WAM! an authorized harassment reporter status. From November 6 to November 26, 2014, they took in reports of Twitter-based harassment, assessed them, and escalated reports as necessary to Twitter for special attention.</p><p> The <a href="http://www.womenactionmedia.org/twitter-report/">subsequent report </a>is interesting if unpleasant reading. It involved 811 incoming reports of harassment  and discussed a range of issues such as different kinds of harassment (including doxxing), problems with duplicate reports and those sent by a bot (over 250), the problems of evidence for both reporting to Twitter and law enforcement, and the impact of reviews cases upon staff. Not surprisingly members of the WAM! staff and board themselves received harassment on Twitter as a result of the reporting project including hate speech, distribution of photoshopped images and false information, and rape and death threats. </p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2NDgzODQ5MzgyMTQzNTgz.png"></figure><p>Since the report, Twitter has made a number of changes the process of abuse reporting, from simplified forms<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/making-it-easier-to-report-threats-to-law-enforcement"> to making it easier to report threats to law enforcement. </a></p><p>Twitter has also cracked down on doxxing and revenge porn with <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/twitter-tackles-revenge-porn?bftw&amp;utm_term=.opZBvj79K#.ac8068gxp">changes to its usage policies</a> in March 2015. People who get caught posting other people's identifying information, intimate videos and photos without their consent will have their accounts locked until they delete the offending posts. And repeat offenders will get suspended from Twitter. For the revenge porn, Twitter will take stuff down without a DMCA request as long as the person complaining verifies that it's them in the photos or videos.</p><p>It is imperative that anyone wanting to create new technology in the long term, whether it be IoT, a new form of internet communication, subcutaneous wearables or blockchain structures is able to anticipate and to some extent predict what could go wrong over with a product over a lifetime.</p><h2><strong>Focus On The Capabilities Of Your Product To Do Good</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2NDgzODMzODEyODg3MTM1.jpg"></figure><p>Perhaps Twitter's (and by virtue Periscope's) greatest strength is its ability to connect people in situations that benefit from leaderless self-organising and direct action but rely on  public communication like the Arab Spring or the #blacklivesmatter campaign. Twitter's ability to create a platform for civilians on the ground reporting cannot be underestimated. </p><p>This is further strengthened by its partnership with Periscope, whose founders came up with the idea while traveling abroad in 2013. Kayvon Beykpour was in Istanbul when protests broke out in Taksim Square. He wanted to see what was happening there, so he turned to Twitter. While he could read about the protests, he could not see them.  </p><p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/10/exclusive-biz-stone-on-twitter-and-activism/64772/">These kinds of benefits</a> are tangible and effective and can reinforce the benefits of Twitter at a time when it is accused of lacking an engaged audience. Likewise, most new technology has great capacity for social action through its functionality or the scope of its audience or consumer basis. </p><p>It will be interesting to see what Twitter comes up with next. There's still a need for it in a space of crowded social media if the member-led hash tweet campaigns are anything to go by. People don't react to change unless they are invested in the outcome and people have shown that they want Twitter to stay- for the time being.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Future of Wearables Is Implanted</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's interesting how many people recoil at the idea of implanted wearables. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant">Cochlear implants</a> have been around since the 1980's, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etonogestrel_contraceptive_implant">contraceptive implants</a> since the late 1990's and a plethora of implanted devices have either kept people alive or improved their quality of life from knee replacements to pacemakers. Meanwhile, wearable devices  are getting smaller and smarter. It's  only a small stretch of the imagination to envisage a time of wearables worn  subcutaneously (below the skin) and monitored outside of the body. The relationship of technology and science is a fascinating and are a few of the most innovative ways implants are transforming the lives of many:</p><p><strong>Brain implants to treat major health conditions</strong></p><p>The manipulation of the brain through the use of technological devices is accepted practice in serious conditions where medication and other forms of treatment have been unsuccessful. Research into brain-based disorders has lead to treatment like <a href="http://www.epilepsy.com/learn/treating-seizures-and-epilepsy/devices/vagus-nerve-stimulation-vns">Vagus nerve stimulation</a> to treat severe epilepsy. Psychiatric neuro-technology researchers are focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation">Transcranial direct current stimulation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation">Transcranial Magnet Stimulation</a> to treat conditions like chronic pain, pharmaceutical resistant depression, fibromyalgia, OCD, Parkinson's, and schizophrenia.</p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2NjQxNzkxNDM1NzQ0ODYz.jpg"><figcaption>Deep brain stimulation</figcaption></figure><h2>Deep brain stimulation</h2><p>Taking this a step further, deep electrical stimulation of the brain (otherwise known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation">deep brain stimulation</a>) can treat <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/articles/2015/3/13/ocd-patient-brain-implant-gave-me-a-chance-at-happiness.html">severe OCD,</a> depression and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/542176/a-shocking-way-to-fix-the-brain/">a range of other disorders</a>, enabling health professionals to target the specific parts of the brain which cause particular disorders. Electrodes are implanted into the brain and a device incorporating a battery and pulse generator is implanted into the chest or abdomen with wires to the skull connecting the electrodes. When turned on, the device emits an electrical current that stimulates the neural fibers carrying information from primitive brain areas associated with motivation to the frontal lobe.</p><p>It's foreseeable to envision a time when other parts of the brain are better understood and implants are at the forefront curing a range of brain disorders. Some speculate that implants to improve<a href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/186444-us-scientists-push-ahead-with-memory-boosting-brain-implants-but-we-still-have-to-crack-the-brains-code-first"> memory and intelligence</a> could be closer than we think and offer opportunities for developers looking for a new challenge.</p><h2><strong>Brain implants to treat paralysis</strong></h2><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM2NjQ0Nzg1Mjk2NTgyMjM5.webp"></figure><p>A group of Melbourne scientists has made the notion of wirelessly controlled limbs closer to reality through the development of  a tiny, matchstick-sized device called a <a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/moving-with-the-power-of-thought">stentrode</a>. Once implanted into a blood vessel next to the motor cortex, the brain’s control centre, it will pick up brain signals and allow patients to move a robotic exoskeleton attached to their limbs simply by thinking about it. It picks up strong electrical frequencies emitted by the brain that are coded into a computer. The computer then sends a signal to an exoskeleton attached to the arms or legs, enabling movement. The success of the stentrobe is heightened due to its location - a blood vessel - which eschews the need for complex brain surgery.</p><p>In late 2017, a select group of paralysed patients from the Royal Melbourne and Austin Hospitals in Australia will be chosen for the trial, where they will be implanted with the stentrode. If the trial succeeds, the technology could become commercially available in as little as six years.</p><h2><strong>The Bionic eye is here</strong></h2><p>Technology restoring sight and making super sight is here.  In January Rhian Lewis, legally blind had a tiny electronic chip  implanted at the back of the retina in her right eye. &nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2NjQ1MTI1OTQwOTc5Mjk3.jpg"></figure><p><a href="http://oxfordbrc.nihr.ac.uk/blind-womans-joy-as-she-reads-the-time-thanks-to-bionic-eye/">A wafer-thin retinal implant chip</a> was inserted into the back of the eye to replace damaged photoreceptors. The chip captures the light entering the eye to stimulate the nerve cells of the inner retina to deliver signals to the brain through the optic nerve. The device is connected to a tiny computer that sits underneath the skin behind the ear. This is powered by a magnetic coil which is applied to the skin – from the outside, this looks similar to a hearing aid. The device is switched on once everything has healed up after the surgery. Using dials on a small wireless power supply held in the hand, Rhian can adjust the sensitivity, contrast and frequency to obtain the best possible signal for different conditions.</p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2NjY2MjY4NDU0MzY0NzY5.jpg"></figure><p>Another option for those tired of wearing glasses is the Bionic Lens, the brainchild of the  <a href="http://ocumetics.com/">Ocumetics Technology Corp</a>, a company who want to eliminate glasses and contact lenses forever. T<a href="http://ocumetics.com/">he Ocumetics Bionic Lens</a> is the result of eight years of research and $3 million in funding and lets you see “three times better than 20/20 vision” without wearing any contacts or glasses at all — for an entire lifetime.  Amazingly the surgery is estimated to cost around $3,200 per eye with approval predicted to be between 2-5 years.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Contraceptive Microchip</strong></h2><p><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2015/implantable-drug-delivery-microchip-device-0629">MIT spinout Microchips Biotech</a> has been working on a birth-control microchip, backed by the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, that releases contraceptives and can be turned on and off wirelessly. The tiny chip has an antenna and battery and is designed to be implanted under the skin, where it stores hormones and releases a precise dose at scheduled intervals. Unlike other contraceptive devices, it does not have to be removed when the woman wants to have children. It can be turned on and off with a remote control.</p><h2><strong>Wearable Implants Could Make Life Easier - Or More Complex</strong></h2><p>Exploration into implanted RFID chips has been around for a while. A chip implanted in the hand could <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-31042477">unlock doors</a>, <a href="http://hackaday.com/2010/01/14/start-the-car-with-a-wave-of-your-hand/">start a car</a> or be an alternative to a swipe card. It's easy to imagine the contactless jacket embedded with a bPay chip being replaced by an implant. But  it could also verify a person's identity in case of an emergency or during war time.  It could be used to store a person's medical records. A number of people have told me that the ease of removing an RFID chip (with a scalpel presumably) could result in identity or financial theft. Others raise the issues of hacking and long-term medical complications caused by implants. But regardless of resistance, this technology is here, it is being used successfully for a range of purposes and it will be an integral part of wearables of the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What To Expect At This Year&#039;s Mobile World Congress</title>
		<link>https://readwrite.com/2016/02/19/2016-mwc/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile World Congress (MWC) is a mobile phone tradeshow held annually in Barcelona. It involves over 2,000 companies and 100,000 attendees. While it may have started out with its emphasis firmly planted on mobile devices, its reach now extends to wearables, VR, and all manner of IoT. The event will also showcase drones for the first time. Keynote speakers include CEOs from PayPal, Facebook, AT&amp;T, and Cisco.  I'll be attending and interviewing a series of companies about their businesses and their products. With over 100 emails each day from PR people I thought I should put together some predictions:</p><p><strong>Mobile phone launches</strong></p><p>Most of these will be predictably held pre-conference the day before the real conference commences. Samsung will be launching the Galaxy S7 (great video) and it's most likely the LG G5 will be presented. No real surprise there. I'm more interested in  Xiaomi's launch of its Mi 5 flagship smartphone. It can be bought readily in much of Europe but will they also launch an entry into the US market?</p><p>Likewise, they'll be plenty of discussions and reveals by mobile operators, service providers and transport and utility companies.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm expecting plenty of conversations about mobile security in the wake of Apple's letter this week, with IoT center stage. As a result, the IoT pavilion will be a hotbed of connected technology with plenty of emphasis on IoT security.  Home devices will be getting more attention, especially in regard to home security and lighting,  but B2B devices and platforms (with plenty of emphasis on the cloud) will be on an equal footing with companies like Jasper, GE, and IBM showing their wares.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Beyond the keynotes</strong></p><p>It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of the big name companies, but I'm curious to see what vendors at the Greek Pavilion have to offer given they've been innovating under financially lean circumstances. Companies that not only have survived, but grown, their businesses throughout the six years of Greece’s financial crisis are a testament to the resilience of the country’s growing mobile technology community.</p><p><strong>Wearables</strong></p><p>Wearables were huge at last year's MWC with everything from fitness bands to smart glasses. I've yet to see any wearables that I'm breathlessly waiting for, but there'll be plenty in the medical arena and protective clothing industries to sustain my interest. I'm predicting a touch of AI here as well, particularly in the prosthetics arena.</p><p><strong>5G is coming</strong></p><p>Most of the chatter at MWC will be around 5G, the next generation of the mobile Internet. 2020 has been touted as a deadline for the arrival of 5G, but there is still no global standard for the technology. I'm expecting lots of demonstrations of speed capabilities.</p><p>I'll be talking to lots of people over the week and providing you with plenty of interesting and informative insights. Stay tuned for more from Monday!&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Developers love Australian enterprise software company <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;its first and most popular product,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira?_mid=86ef4f53896fdb61cc6c2cc0e849441c&amp;gclid=CjwKEAiA9c-2BRC_vaaJ0Ybps30SJABlqxDesj6-lKQSkPn5rLh3AA2NkS6_HJh0l59oSTvbui_NvBoC5MDw_wcB">JIRA</a>, used across many applications being developed by teams around the world. It's a product that&nbsp;has grown beyond its developer focus, with Atlassian claiming that over a third of its users come from businesses units outside of software development, including sales, marketing, and HR. Key customers include NASA, Twitter, and Tesla.</p><p>Digging into Atlassian's app marketplace reveals that great software isn’t just being created by big brand developer outfits or tech companies, but by small shops and teams of developers around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Servicing B2B businesses and clients through this marketplace, they’re part of a thriving app economy – real developers, real products and real payouts. I recently spoke to two development companies that are Atlassian vendors, <a href="http://tempo.io/">Tempo</a> and <a href="http://www.getzephyr.com/">Zephyr</a>, about their experiences in a B2B app store. &nbsp;They reveal an interesting story often neglected by the excitement of B2C.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tempo</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2OTIyNTk2OTM0NDI4MjU1.png"><figcaption>Tempo Logo</figcaption></figure><p><a href="http://tempo.io/">Tempo</a> is&nbsp;one of the top-selling add-on vendors in the Atlassian ecosystem, offering a number of products that extend JIRA to help business teams collaborate, plan, track, and work more efficiently together. From tracking annual leave budgets and time off, to timesheets within project management, Tempo helps teams execute. I recently spoke with&nbsp;Jessica VanderVeen, Tempo's VP Marketing &amp; Communication, to learn a bit about the company. She revealed Tempo emerged from a start-up innovation day and their time-tracking system, launched in 2009, was one of the first to enter the system.</p><p>Tempo decided to join Atlassian's marketplace early on, attracted to their "strong values and efficient sales model." VanderVeen adds that Atlassian has "really set a good example for developers in the ecoyststem."</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p><em>"Being part of a marketplace like Atlassian has enabled us to create a lucrative product, increase brand awareness and marketing. It's meant that all sales work has been migrated, enabling us to focus on development, doing what we are good at."&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>It's been a good move for Tempo. They've grown from one to four products with a team of over 75, with&nbsp;offices in Reykjavík, Iceland, and Montréal, Canada. Their over-7,000 customers include&nbsp;Dell, Netflix, Ebay and BMW.&nbsp;</p><p>Tempo won two awards at last November's Atlassian Summit: top-selling cloud add-on at the Atlassian Marketplace and <a href="https://vimeo.com/123619184">most creative marketing campaign</a>&nbsp;that was&nbsp;actually a great April Fool's Day prank. Yet they are still intent on focusing on what they do best - developing. "We’re really interested in building cloud solutions," says VanderVeen. "We have additional products that we’d like to launch, and we want to continue to expand on mobile offering."</p><h2>Zephyr</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2OTI0MTc1MDY2NDc0MDgx.jpg"><figcaption>&nbsp;Zephyr logo</figcaption></figure><p><a href="http://www.getzephyr.com/">Zephyr</a> is provider of on-demand, real-time enterprise test management solutions, providing developers with a&nbsp;test management tool to allow software developers and testers to manage all of their testing before they release their products on the unsuspecting public.</p><p>I spoke to Samir Shah, founder and CEO of Zephyr, about their experiences in deciding to join forces with Atlassian:</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p><em>"We got in touch with Atlassian in 2008, actually when they had just opened an office here in San Francisco. Customers were actually asking us, 'Hey, what about an integration to JIRA?' We didn’t know what JIRA was at that point in time (and) when we did our research, (we) found it was something called Atlassian and they had an office in San Francisco. We met with them and we integrated our product with them.&nbsp;This was a refreshing different way of working because here we are, a small company walking up to this company and saying, 'Hey, we want to integrate.' They are like, 'Sure. What do you want? Here is the source code. Here is the API. How can we help you?' We’re like 'Wait a second. Nobody works this way.' Well, Atlassian did and they’ve continued to do that. It was extremely appealing to us to go off and build our integration. It didn’t just stop there."</em></p></blockquote><p>Like Tempo, Zephyr had found the independent marketplace challenging but rewarding: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p><em>&nbsp;"It’s not easy marketing and selling and going and finding your customers and dealing with them one by one to make sales happen. (But) w</em><em>e are adding ten new customers every single day off of these platforms. This shrinks the world. This shrinks the world in such a huge way. There was no way I was going to be able to sell my software in the Maldives. I can’t even find the Maldives on a map, let alone set up a sales team in an office and try and sell software to 106 different countries. That’s this whole change that we are seeing right now. Software is no more the purview of these large organizations that build huge monolithic suites that you have to buy as a whole. At this point in time, you buy exactly what and how much you want."</em></p></blockquote><p>It certainly seems that Zephyr is giving customers what they want, having grown from 20 to 80 people in the company over four years. They now have over 7,000 customers and more than 1 million users around the globe. With their success, Atlassian also reaps the benefits of the marketplace and the relationships it continues to build with these dynamic development teams &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month <a href="http://www.theneura.com/">Neura</a> announced that it raised &nbsp;a $11 million Series A funding round. The company calls itself 'the ethical personalization service for the Internet of Things' which stands for "Smarter Technology. Powered by Trust." They're leading in innovation in the creation of personalized data.</p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2NzgyNTE1NTAyMzkyOTI5.jpg"></figure><p>Neura’s technology utilizes smarter integrations through machine learning to enable users to get to an unprecedented level of technology personalization. Apps and devices are enriched with insights not only about users’ past and present actions but also calculated predictions about the next thing they’re going to do. I met with Denis&nbsp;Vitchevsky, VP Strategy yesterday and I was keen to hear how such predictive technology might work in practice. He explains:</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p>"If you are listening to Spotify,&nbsp;we can tell Spotify your location and who you are with and Spotify will adapt what music is played accordingly, for example, play songs that suit driving or that will suit the tastes of both you and your partner."</p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2NzgyNTE1NTAyNDU4NDY1.jpg"></figure><p>This kind of intuitive learning can provide a plethora of conveniences to everyday life from a&nbsp;smart door lock that can request to know when you fall asleep at home, in order to check that the door is locked when it happens; to a&nbsp;smart car &nbsp;requesting to know when you're sleep deprived and when your blood sugar is low if you're a diabetic, in order to turn on extra safety features.</p><figure><img src="http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/media/MTM2NzgyNTE1NTAyMzI3Mzkz.jpg"></figure><p>The data gleaned by Neura has an extensive range of potential commercial audiences and applications from car manufacturers gleaning information about how people drive their cars to urban planners learning a consumer's geolocation over a period of time. Not to mention the extensive data that can be mined from health devices and apps.&nbsp;</p><p>Neura believes that the digital identity of the consumer (generated by a consumer's technology use) can enable connected products to become more intuitive.&nbsp;However, it's worth stressing that in contrast to other companies, Neura works at creating a more ethical data sharing ecosystem. The digital identity&nbsp;can only be utilized with the express permission of users, giving individuals complete and irrevocable control over their data – allowing them to share only what they’re comfortable with, in exchange for tangible value.</p><p>This is an interesting point of difference.&nbsp;Neura’s business model is to give their users a smart solution for interacting with their IoT space and selling data gleaned from their actions and preferences to their partners. For example, sharing your Fitbit data with an insurance company may result in cheaper insurance premiums. Or sharing your Google map geography could result in a discount by a car hire company. With their CTO&nbsp;Triinu Magi having been previously employed at&nbsp;RSA, the Security Division of EMC, it's clear they take privacy seriously. &nbsp;</p><p>Vitchevsky comments,</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p>"Tech companies often see data as a monetization opportunity instead of helping the people they gathered it from. In turn, users are too willing to cede control of their personal information so they can use services like Google Maps or Facebook."&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Neura's API and SDK are available on Github for keen IoT developers to utilize and the company is hoping to launch on IoS soon (currently only in beta mode).&nbsp;Vitchevsky shared that they are currently teaming up with a range of companies engaged in IoT and health and it will be interesting to see what comes next.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a> yesterday announced the formation of &nbsp;the OPEN-Orchestrator Project (OPEN-O) at<a href="https://www.mobileworldcongress.com/"> Mobile World Congress</a> (MWC). Their aim is to bring the industry together to develop the first open source software framework and orchestrator to enable agile software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) operations.&nbsp;Early support for OPEN-O comes from Brocade, China Mobile, China Telecom, DynaTrace, Ericsson, F5 Networks, GigaSpaces, Huawei, Infoblox, Intel, KT, Red Hat, Raisecom, Riverbed, and ZTE. OPEN-O is inviting others interested in this technology to participate.</p><p>Next-generation networking technologies such as SDN, NFV, and cloud computing are enabling autonomous, real-time telecom operations. As an open source orchestration framework, OPEN-O will integrate open networking technologies and enable carriers to quickly and cost-effectively implement SDN and NFV through open source code development. The project will also aim to accelerate multi-vendor integration, service innovation and improve agility across network operations.</p><p>OPEN-O will follow governance practices consistent with Linux Foundation projects, which could include a Technical Steering Committee and an End User Advisory board to ensure alignment of needs between the technical and end-user communities. The project intends to create a development and testing platform as well as build and support an open source developer community.</p><p>Chris Wright, vice president and chief technologist of Red Hat comments:</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p>“Open source is already producing significant innovations in NFV and SDN, helping telecommunications to modernize and move to next-generation networks. Management and network operations (MANO) represents a critical pillar of NFV solutions and to achieve real interoperability, it needs to be built collaboratively by open source community efforts. OPEN-O offers the potential to drive even more collaboration and faster innovation, with many industry leaders working together to advance networking operations.”</p></blockquote><p>The news comes a week after the announcement of the <a href="http://openconnectivity.org/">Open Connectivity Foundation </a>(OCF), an entity whose goal will be to help unify IoT standards so that companies and developers can create IoT solutions and devices that work seamlessly together. Via cross-industry collaboration, the OCF will work towards unlocking the massive opportunity of the future global IoT segment, accelerate industry innovation and help all developers and companies create solutions that map to a single, open IoT interoperability specification. These specifications will mean that a wide range of consumer, enterprise and embedded devices and sensors from a variety of manufacturers, can securely and seamlessly interact with one another.</p><p>The OCF currently sponsors the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iotivity.org/">IoTivity</a> project, with the primary goal of the project to release and maintain an open source, production-quality implementation of &nbsp;OCF specifications that will, in turn, shape an industry standard.&nbsp;</p><p>Over a hundred businesses and academic bodies have joined the Foundation including Intel, IBM, Cisco, and Honeywell. They strive to get&nbsp;industry consolidation around a common, interoperable approach through a scalable solution - something which will be imperative if the IoT trend continues to grow at its current escalating pace.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Vayyar&#039;s Walabot Will Transform 3D Technology As We Know It</title>
		<link>https://readwrite.com/2016/02/26/vayaar-walabot/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vayyar, a 3D imaging sensor    company&nbsp;<em>–</em>&nbsp;with technology    making it    possible    to    see    through    objects,    liquids and    materials&nbsp;<em>–</em>&nbsp;announced the    launch    of    Walabot last week,    a    consumer    version    of    its    3D    imaging    system.</p><p>
Walabot’s    powerful    sensor    technology    can    look    through    walls    to    detect    structural foundations,    track    a    person’s    location    and    vital    signs    as    they    move    through    a smart home,    measure    the    speed    of    a    fast moving ball,    and help    drones    and    cars    avoid    collisions.&nbsp;</p><p>
The product's capabilities have been described as akin to Superman x-ray vision and I was excited to meet with Raviv Melamed, Vayyar's CEO and co-founder, at Mobile World Congress this week. &nbsp;</p><p>
Vayyar's initial foray into sensor technology centred around breast cancer screening. Melamed explained: &nbsp;</p><p><em>
"More than 40% of insured woman in the United States don't conduct early stage breast cancer screenings – an astonishing number given these tests are routine and often covered by insurance policies. Our vision with Vayyar is that woman won't need to go to special screening clinics for mammograms performed in big, bulky and uncomfortable machines and instead, can use Vayyar at their regular check-up appointment. Vayyar is safe, portable, compact, light, and most importantly, inexpensive. As such, Vayyar can also be used in countries with limited medical resources."&nbsp;</em></p><p>
But it soon becomes clear that Vayyar's 3D imaging capabilities extended beyond breast cancer detection devices as Melamed discussed:&nbsp;</p><p><em>
"We originally created Vayyar sensors to detect early stage breast cancer, but we quickly realized how powerful our technology was and how useful it could be in other industries. Because our sensors can be used in nearly every scenario where non-destructive testing and the ability to detect different anomalies in an object is needed, it can be used in multiple use cases across many different industries." &nbsp;</em></p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2ODU1ODQ5OTIxNDIyOTQz.png"><figcaption>Walabot's new sensor</figcaption></figure><p>
"<em>Walabot can    help    the    blind avoid    obstacles,    sense    – and    alert    you    – if    your mother    or    father    has    fallen    in    the    shower, help    your    robot    become autonomous and    much    more."</em></p><p>Walabot will launch soon and Melamed hopes for big things:
</p><p><em>"It'll be interesting to see what makers, curious inventors and innovators around the world create when we release our API to the public in April. The power of Vayyar's 3D sensor is truly special, and this community will have a great time discovering its potential. When Walabot launches in April, the product will ship with a Vayyar-created app in addition to a community-created app that people around the world can enjoy."&nbsp;</em></p><p>
Walabot    will    range    in    price    from    $99 to    $599 and is currently available for preorder. This is going change 3D technology as we know it and is definitely one to watch.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>EASY IoT Changes Touchless Technology As We Know It</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ellipticlabs.com/">Elliptic Labs</a> has been passionate about gesture-controlled technology since its founding in 2006. While much of their energy has been focused on a touch-free mobile phone experience - enabling hands-free video recording and selfies - they unveiled EASY IoT software at Mobile World Congress, allowing controlling IoT appliances to take place with simple hand gestures. The technology can be applicable to devices like smart thermostats, kitchen appliances, lighting controls, and security systems, to name a few.
</p><p>The company will be offering EASY IoT technology to mobile manufacturers for inclusion in their products. “By working closely with mobile manufacturers and their IoT innovation departments, we enable consumers to easily connect, control, and interact with IoT devices,” explained Laila Danielsen, CEO of Elliptic Labs. “Ultrasound is such a versatile yet robust technology that creating solutions for home use, as we are demoing today, is just the beginning."
</p><p>EASY IoT works by using ultrasonic presence-detection to wake up devices and enable touchless gesture capabilities. When a device detects the presence of a hand or body, it turns itself to waiting or active mode, ready to be used. The technology can be embedded in any device and OEMs can assign any meaning to a gesture depending on the application and the location where the gesture is performed.
</p><p>Available exclusively from Elliptic Labs, ultrasonic touchless gesture technology has already proven itself superior to other approaches, such as optical or infrared sensors. Ultrasonic technology is the only such solution that can deliver full 3D interaction all around a device at 180 degrees. The exceptionally wide interaction zone, together with low power consumption and functionality in any lighting conditions, make ultrasound a winning technology for tomorrow’s connected home.
</p><p>The revolutionary ultrasound technology from Elliptic Labs works much like radar, sending out sound waves that bounce off objects and deliver back information via microphones built into existing devices. Elliptic Labs’ software converts this information into a command for the mobile device or IoT appliance. Does the gesture controlling look strange? Perhaps, at first, but once you've demoed switching a lamp on and off with a gesture and  learn that the small sensors use very little battery power, you start to believe that this could change the lives of not only devices but also their users.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://readwrite.com/2015/03/24/cyanogen-microsoft-team-up-google">Cyanogen Inc</a>. is a company with an interesting history. It grew from a <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">community of open source mobile developers</a> interested in modifying their mobile phones into a successful business of third-party firmware.&nbsp;</p><p>Their best known product,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>CyanogenMod, is an open-source operating system for&nbsp;smartphones and tablet computers, based on the Android mobile platform. It is developed as free and open-source software based on the official releases of Android by Google, with added original and third-party code. &nbsp;They're <a href="https://readwrite.com/2013/11/11/cyanogen-steve-kondik-android">not without controversy</a>, particularly due to their desire to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/cyanogen-google-kirt-mcmaster-582373/">"Take away Android from Google."</a>&nbsp;They announced a<a href="https://cyngn.com/press/cyanogen-announces-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft"> partnership with Microsoft </a>in April last year, under which&nbsp;Cyanogen would integrate and distribute Microsoft’s consumer apps and services across core categories, including productivity, messaging, utilities, and cloud-based services. As part of this collaboration, Microsoft would create native integrations on Cyanogen OS.</p><p>I met with some of the team at Cyanogen Inc. about their launch of MOD, an integrated mobile platform&nbsp;(not to be confused with CyanogenMod)&nbsp;that will introduce what they call "mods," - intelligent, contextually aware, and lightweight experiences built natively into the mobile operating system. &nbsp;These mean that third-party applications could take advantage of platform APIs to implement unique experiences directly within the Cyanogen OS.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially MOD enables a series of distinct experiences, none of which require you to "go into" the app to achieve. They include:</p><ul><li>TrueCaller Mod :&nbsp;A global database of over two billion numbers allows this mod to identify incoming spam calls and texts in the native dialer and messenger apps so you can block them for good.</li><li>Social lock screen: Wake your phone up to view trending and relevant posts from your favorite social networks right on the lock screen.</li><li>Skype Mod: This is integrated directly into the native dialer. You can even upgrade to a Skype video call directly from an ongoing phone call.</li><li>Cortana Mod: Allows you to do everything from setting reminders and scheduling meetings to calling and texting friends. It is also enabled with a voice-activated countdown timer for selfie shots.&nbsp;</li><li>OneNote Mod:&nbsp;Take notes simply and intuitively anytime—from anywhere in the OS. The OneNote mod creates entry points throughout the OS, from the dialer to the browser and beyond. There's even a dedicated quick settings tile so you can jot down a quick note anytime.</li><li>Hyperlapse Mod:&nbsp;Simply open the native camera app, pull up the mode switcher and select Hyperlapse. Now you can shoot, edit, and share Hyperlapse videos without ever needing to download a special app.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2OTQ2OTI5NTM0NzcyODMz.png"><figcaption>Float notes mean you can jot down a note at any time.</figcaption></figure><p>The team gave me a demo of MOD and explained that they considered apps to be "single minded and boring:"&nbsp;</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p><em>"With mods, barriers to deeper integration are removed and developers can now unleash the full potential of their applications across the OS. &nbsp;Users can conveniently access their workout playlist with voice-activation, schedule a ride-sharing service from within their calendar, and make a video conference call from their contacts list. The system will even nudge users to install the perfect mod to help you complete the task at hand. "</em></p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2OTQ3MjQ2MDIwMTc1NDU3.png"><figcaption>Voice activated photos make hands-free selfies easy</figcaption></figure><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>MOD Ready Brings Speed and Scale to OEMs and MNOs</strong></p><p>The challenge for Cyanogen is to ensure the technology can keep up with demand. To accelerate time-to-market for devices running MOD, Cyanogen has created MOD Ready, a scaling program that enables original equipment manufacturers (OEM)&nbsp;and mobile network operators (MNO) to rapidly launch phones across a broad range of chipset platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of the MOD Ready program, Cyanogen will provide a Platform Development Kit (PDK) consisting of all the major components needed to launch a MOD enabled device. In addition, Cyanogen will work closely with major chipset providers to update the PDK roadmap with new chipsets on a quarterly basis. Since Cyanogen OS is CTS-compliant, MOD Ready devices will allow partners to take advantage of the existing Android ecosystem.</p><p>The MOD platform will begin rolling out next month on devices with Cyanogen OS 13.0 or greater. It'll be interesting to see how this is received, I suspect they might have just created the norm of the future.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Smart Home market competing ecosystems is frustrating customers, according to a new report from <a href="http://www.argusinsights.com">Argus Insights</a>. The report looks at the top current options for home connectivity and finds consumers less than delighted with an old tech theme - a lack of desire of competing technologies to work together.

In particular, Google and Apple’s refusal to "play nice together" irks users who are happier with the broad and relatively easier-to-integrate Amazon Echo.

According to data compiled from over 576,000 Smart Home device and application consumer reviews from January 2015 to present, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-SK705DI-Echo/dp/B00X4WHP5E">Amazon Echo</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/homekit/">Apple’s Homekit</a> are top-of-mind for consumers specifically discussing ecosystems.

The Amazon Echo has gained strong consumer interest since the product was broadly promoted at the recent Consumer Electronics Show. Interestingly, the Works with Nest environment is the least discussed ecosystem of those researched.

<figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2OTY5ODA3MjE0OTQ1ODg3.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Apple's Homekit rates favourably</figcaption></figure>John Feland, CEO of report authors Argus Insights, explains:

<em>“Consumers enter the Smart Home journey under the premise of creating an intelligent home that anticipates and serves their needs in a delightful, low maintenance manner. Along this journey, after users overcome the hurdles of installation and continued use through often broken app experiences, they are confronted with a mess of protocols as they approach expansion.” </em>

<em> “Consumers are dismissing Google’s Nest ecosystem play, and we are seeing a real battle between <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/">Apple’s Siri</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.dee.app&amp;hl=en">Amazon’s Alexa</a> for the voice of the Smart Home. While Apple forces users to rely on iOS devices, Alexa will chat up anyone willing to integrate into the Echo API.” </em>

It's worth noting that using reviews as a measurement tool of satisfaction may result in skewed data - people tend to be more inclined to take the time to review a negatively received product than a positive one. Further, a customer's needs at the early stages of the home IoT experience may differ greatly than when they want to try more complex integrations and connections.

Currently, Google only works with Nest, HomeKit only works with iOS devices, and Alexa works with everyone.  Interconnectivity and the ability to function in multi-user environments will become more important as people introduce more smart devices into their home. Companies unwilling to facilitate this may soon find themselves passed over, however strong the consumer brand recognition.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does your love of tech extend to the pets in your life? When you look into the pettech world, there's a bewildering plethora of mobile apps to aid our furry friends from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id875026451?mt=8">adopting a dog</a>,<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/DE/app/id327583274?mt=8"> deciding on a pet nam</a>e, administering <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cube.arc.pfa">first aid</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;choosing a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bringfido-pet-friendly-hotels/id682820712?mt=8">pet-friendly holiday</a> location - and we haven't even gotten into the entire range of interactive gadgets and accessories.&nbsp;</p><p>Pets are big business—the <a href="http://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp">American Pet Products Association</a> estimates that consumers spent nearly $61 billion on their pets in 2015. &nbsp;According to <a href="http://www.idtechex.com/research/reports/wearable-technology-for-animals-2015-2025-technologies-markets-forecasts-000391.asp">IDTechEx,</a>&nbsp; ten years from now the wearable tech market for pets is expected to reach $2.6 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have the cash, here's a critical look at some of the more innovative tools to entertain and support your four-legged family members.</p><h2>CleverPet&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM1Nzg2MDM2NjUwMzIyNTYz.png"><figcaption>The CleverPet&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>With inspiration straight from the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning">Ivan Pavlov</a>, the <a href="http://getcleverpet.com/">CleverPet </a>uses cutting-edge algorithms based on behavioural science to reward your dog when she learns something new.&nbsp;A busy dog is a happy dog. Your dog is less likely to be distraught or destructive while you’re out if they have something productive to do, and playing games is a great way to keep them occupied.</p><p>The device has three sensitive touch pads designed for dog noses and paws, which light up interactively. Your pet will win food for touching the pads on the device with the difficulty escalating over time. You can also see how they are doing in real time via the corresponding app. You can even pre-record verbal commands for training work.</p><p>CleverPet is connectable to other smart device and Arduino-compatible. A tech savvy owner can also write their own custom code via the available RESTful API.</p><h2>PetBot</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2MDg4MDQxMzAyMzIzMTcw.png"><figcaption>Look deep into my dispenser...</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.petbot.co/">PetBot</a>&nbsp;also takes a page from Pavlov's book, a focused towards the welfare of the owner than the pet, although it may be more focused on the owner's well-being. Think of it as a reward-dispensing baby monitor. It allows the owner to see, speak and listen to their pet through their smartphone.&nbsp;When the pet cuddles up to the camera, PetBot automatically starts recording a ten-second video or selfie image and dispenses a treat or plays a pre-recorded sound as a reward. The danger here? Finding out your pet thinks you're more boring than you realize.</p><h2>Whistle, FitBark and Wonderwoof wearables&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2MDg5NzEyMzEzMDM2Nzcw.jpg"><figcaption>Wonderwoof's wearable activity tracker</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;Of all wearables for dogs, three similar devices are getting the bulk of the attention:&nbsp;<a href="https://readwrite.com/2013/11/12/whistle-tracker-dog">Whistle</a>, <a href="http://www.fitbark.com/">FitBark </a>and <a href="https://www.wonderwoof.com/">Wonderwoof</a>.&nbsp;They all feature a small device that clips onto your dog's collar and monitors your dog's resting and activity levels. These are then compared to a pre-calculated range based on their breed, age and weight. Where these devices differ is in their corresponding apps. Whistle, for example, enables owners to keep track of medications as well as a food log. The app can also be shared by multiple family members. Whistle also retails a GPS tracker, although it would be nice to see this integrated into the wearable rather than as separate product in the future.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whistle.com/activity-monitor/">Whistle</a> is also the first consumer device to tap into Sigfox’s low-power IoT network. By comparison, <a href="http://www.fitbark.com/">FitBark</a> can be linked to an owner's Fitbit and has the option of a separate wifi base accessory - at a cost of $80 - for monitoring multiple dogs. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wonderwoof.com/">Wonderwoof </a>app also enables the owner to track the location of "doggy friends" while you're out walking. Don't worry, cats - a Wondermeow is in the works this year.&nbsp;</p><h2>Voyce </h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2MTU5NzQzMzY1MzU2MzQ1.jpg"><figcaption>Fetching his first wearable: Voyce</figcaption></figure><p><a href="http://voyce.com/">Voyce</a> is a health-focused wearable collar for dogs that does everything some of th above activity wearables do, but also measures sunlight exposure as well as heart and respiratory rates. Designed by a team of veterinarians, Voyce's strength is that the health information can be made available to your dog's veterinarian.&nbsp;Voyce is more than double the cost of other health monitoring devices and a membership plan - around $100 per year - is required to have access to the corresponding online portal.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2OTY4NTA2Mzc2NzI2MTEx.png"><figcaption>Voyce's accompanying pet record</figcaption></figure><p>An owner can activate the "caregiver" option, giving their pet’s vet access to all of the Voyce monitor’s data. A separate Voyce Pro program enables veterinarians to actively monitor their patients.</p><p>The collar comes in different sizes, but it may prove too uncomfortable for many dogs. Some reviews complained that the collar's bulky looks got them some evil looks - owners were accused of having their pet wear a shock collar. But this kind of detailed monitoring wearable will likely become a precedent for future developers, albeit hopefully in a more ergonomic collar.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ipad Games ....for Cats? (And Lonely Penguins....)</h2><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM2MTU3OTM1NDUyNTkyMDgz.jpg"></figure><p>Have you ever found your cat watching television? Their entertainment needn't be usurped by your own, thanks to <a href="http://www.ipadgameforcats.com/">Ipad Games for Cats</a>. I had a chat with game designer TJ Fuller, part of the duo that created <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.littlehiccup.GameForCats">Game for Cats</a> app. The idea came from seeing videos of cats playing with iPads on YouTube, but the impetus was a lengthy failed attempt at making children's games. They decided to see what they could make in two weeks and the resulting game - where cats can play with mice, lasers and butterflies - was a hit.  Since then, two other games have featured in the kitty reportoire, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paint-for-cats/id427702410?mt=8">Paint for Cats </a>and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/catzilla/id641891200?mt=8">Catzilla</a>. </p><p>The experiences in creating games for cats highlight some of the challenges for developers in working with animals. With the first beta version, the developers knew they were at a loss for market research - neither had a cat or even an Ipad. Buying an iPad was easy, and they took it to the local pet shelter to test the game.</p><p>"The women at the shelter didn’t know what the iPad was but the cats loved it immediately," says Fuller. "It became really popular right away." &nbsp;</p><p>The game also proved popular at the&nbsp;aquarium in Long Beach, California - particularly with the penguins that experienced increased sex drives after playing the game.&nbsp;</p><p>There was also some unintended consequences in the first game, which began with free levels and extended to paid levels. Users complained that money was being taken from their accounts without their consent. It turned out that the cats were pressing their paw on the "buy now" button. After that, they introduced a failsafe where a buyer needed a credit card and a human hand to make a payment. </p><p>Fuller says the biggest challenge in making games for cats is that their capacity for engagement differs significantly to humans. Cat owners wanted a more advanced game for their cats. But after going all-out with their third game,&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/catzilla/id641891200?mt=8">Catzilla</a>, they found that the game appealed to owners more than cats. As one reviewer wrote:</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p><em>"Whereas our kitties will sit, purring loudly in anticipation, staring at a blank iPad WAITING for me to turn on the Painting game, they completely ignored this game visually and got very scared of the siren sounds". </em></p></blockquote><p>This led to lower-than-expected sales despite the first two apps selling consistently for several years. Fuller notes that testing is the key in creating product for pets. He explained a recent frustrating situation where they were working on another game for months, only to find out during beta testing that cats just would not play it.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, it's easy for the petless out there to smirk at both the tech sector's and pet owners' desires for pettech. But most owners consider their pets a member of the family and valu their well-being. However, there are concerns that the&nbsp;market could easily become overly saturated with products which are targeted at behavioural modification through "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-SCOUTTRAINER25-Collar-Remote-Training/dp/B00SFW0LX6">static correction</a>"&nbsp;and other forms of control, which can seem cruel and archaic - and at odds with the benefits of the majority of pet wearables and apps. But hopefully, tails will keep wagging.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Noveto Systems Changes Sound As We Know It</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's not that often that you witness a product demonstration that absolutely blows your mind. But at last week's Mobile World Congress, Israeli company&nbsp;Noveto Systems&nbsp;did just that. They are developing the next-generation of human-machine vocal interface, enabling sound-emitting devices to transmit&nbsp;sound beams to the user's ears only, without any external hardware on the user.</p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM3MDE0MDk3OTkxNDQ0MDUx.gif"><figcaption>How Noveto's interface works</figcaption></figure><p>It's a combination of cameras and sensors that track the user’s head, using positional 3D face tracking along with wave-shaping algorithms and special transducers that send a focused audio beam into each ear. Through this use of&nbsp;face tracking, Noveto can change where the beam of audio is aimed or fire out multiple beams to people sitting next to each other on a sofa. &nbsp;</p><p>I tried it using a dock connected to a mobile phone. It's a strange sensation when the sound suddenly hits your ears - not at all painful or uncomfortable but crystal clear. Skeptical, I also made one of the Noveto management team do the demo, and yes, I could not hear anything! It was nothing short of amazing.</p><p>I can see loads of applications for the Noveto - watching TV without disturbing a partner sitting next to you. For gamers, Noveto can also beam separate audio tracks to individual users, so you could have a split-screen game where each player hears something different. It can also provide higher volume for someone hearing-impaired. The technology could just as easily have applications in personal computing, IoT and automobiles.</p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM3MDE2NDM5Mjg1NDkxMjgy.jpg"><figcaption>Now you won't drive her crazy in bed</figcaption></figure><p>Noveto believes this technology will be available commercially in the next twelve months, most likely through partnering with a bigger brand. It's definitely one to keep an eye on - it could change sound as we know it. &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Flexport takes on freight world</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology is disrupting traditional industries from printing to manufacturing - and now you can add freight forwarding to that list. Usually, freight forwarding is an industry where global supply chains are clouded by lack of visibility, confusing paperwork, complicated regulations, rampant price discrimination, and unpredictable delays.&nbsp;</p><p>I spoke to Ryan Petersen, CEO and founder of <a href="https://www.flexport.com">Flexport</a>, who explained the traditional freight forwarding process is compounded by&nbsp;importers and exporters having to manage the entire process by telephone, email, fax, or courier. &nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM3MDc4OTQ4NTA4MDgzNzk0.jpg"><figcaption>Ryan Petersen, CEO and founder of Flexport.</figcaption></figure><p>Petersen's background in importing includes working in business with his brother to buy products in China and selling them to consumers in the US. He says the hardest part they experienced was freight, in particular with the paperwork:&nbsp;</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p>"Freight is shipments over 150kg, (so) it can’t can’t go through the parcel network, it won’t go down the conveyor belt and in the world of importing its going to change hands five, six, seven times until it gets to the customer. Yet it's an industry that relies on very antiquated ways of doing business - and as a user I just thought, wow, it shouldn't have to be this hard."</p></blockquote><p>Several years later after launching three successful businesses, learning five languages and spending a stint as a classmate of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator's class of 2014</a>, Flexport was born.&nbsp;</p><p>The company is considered a true disruptor &nbsp;of the freight forwarding industry.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flexport.com/">Flexport</a> offers a full suite of managed importing services, providing a dedicated account management team as well as access to custom brokerage services and competitive freight rates.&nbsp;The traditional means of managing a company’s global freight shipments is replaced with a simple online app that allows the customer to request and book shipments, track all global freight movements in real time, manage product data, visual their supply chain, view analytics and more - all&nbsp;in real time.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM3MDc4OTQ4NTA4MTQ5MzMw.png"><figcaption>Shipment details from Flexport's app</figcaption></figure><p>Flexport has grown its revenue 25% monthly every month since November 2013, and the tech industry has taken notice. In 2015, <a href="https://www.flexport.com/learn/weve-raised-money-to-reinvent-global-trade/">Flexport announced</a> that they had&nbsp;raised $6.9 million in seed funding from investors - including First Round Capital, Google Ventures, Bloomberg BETA, and Y Combinator.&nbsp;Since their beginning, they have grown from a small start-up to a firm of over 100 people, including sales and customer service staff in Amsterdam and Hong Kong and engineers in San Francisco - not to mention a big team of customs brokers.  He says they differentiate themselves from the traditional industry via a combination of software and transportation:&nbsp;</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p>"We're enabling some of the world’s best engineers and logistics people to work together. That is what makes us really competitive."</p></blockquote><p>Petersen explains that they also provide support to start-ups&nbsp;as well as big businesses - clients that&nbsp;traditional&nbsp;freight forwarders weren’t usually willing to provide competitive rates and adequate attention because they focused on serving older, more established companies:</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p>&nbsp;"We have eight publicly traded companies using us now and over 600 companies as customers. It's hard enough to build a brand, design a product, get an audience and manufacture at scale without spending all your energy worrying about the products getting from the factory to the people."</p></blockquote><p>He adds new technologies are well-represented in their client base:</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"><p>"Our customers now include companies in consumer electronics, robotics, and 3D printing along with larger e-commerce businesses that each import hundreds of millions in goods."&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>While most of their customers are currently US-based, they are in a position to help any business go global. "We can make it really easy for European companies to access the US, and for US companies reach Europe and Asia."&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM3MDg0MzA1OTQyNzgzNTcw.jpg"><figcaption>Flexport's quote comparisons</figcaption></figure><p>Petersen offers some perspective on how Flexport has managed to grow so fast, admitting that "it's very hard to get people sold on a vision... I was fortunate that I had started other businesses which helped me with credibility with industry. We spent a lot of time building relationships within the transport industry to get people to change the ways they had been working for a long time and really nuturing those relationships... relationships are an essential part of our business."</p><p>Where to now for Flexport? Their services are clearly in demand - they have a waiting list of companies wanting to use their services - and Petersen imagines a time when they have over 1,000 staff around the world, while musing about the challenge to maintaining "our good culture as we grow." It may not happen overnight, but it might certainly be sooner than we think as Flexport plans to disrupt freight forwarding for the long haul.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Samsung and Six Flags to launch first VR roller coasters</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six Flags Entertainment Corporation and Samsung Electronics America <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/six-flags-and-samsung-partner-to-launch-first-virtual-reality-roller-coasters-in-north-america">recently announced</a> a partnership which names Samsung as the “Official Technology Partner” of the world’s largest regional theme park company. The partnership includes the debut of ground-breaking experiences coming to nine Six Flags theme parks— North America’s first Virtual Reality (VR) roller coasters, using <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/wearables/gear-vr/">Samsung Gear VR powered</a> by Oculus.</p><p>The launch comes less than a month after I recently experienced a Samsung VR roller coaster at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Consistent with theme park reality, you line up patiently until it's your turn - over an hour in my case. You then are seated in a special seat with a hidden motor beneath it, and you strap on your seat belt and don a Samsung Gear VR headset. My experience is still slightly blurry, due to my glasses-wearing, but without them I couldn't see anything at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Loud music starts and an image appears of <a href="https://youtu.be/Df4V0I3oEGs">a Six Flags amusement park in California</a>. All of a sudden, your seat is moving and you are in the first car of a roller coaster train. You are above the trees and you can look all around you - you can see the sky and get a birds' eye view of the amusement park. The train starts to go up a hill and you are climbing the tracks.</p><figure><img src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM3MDg1ODY4NTA1NTcyOTQ3.jpg"><figcaption>Samsung's 4D VR roller coaster at Mobile World Congress.</figcaption></figure><p>The adrenaline kicks in as all of a sudden, whoosh! Your train drops down the roller coaster track with you in it.&nbsp;It’s not as visceral&nbsp;as in real life - your stomach drops only a little - but the 4D experience does make you feel like you’re on a real roller coaster ride. Your chair moves and you are mildly tossed and turned. I left the experience a little dizzy but in good spirits.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How will it play out at Six Flags?</strong></h2><p>Some of Six Flags’ most popular coasters will be equipped to allow riders who are wearing Samsung Gear VR headsets. Visitors still physically go on a moving roller coaster, but the VR headset provides hyperreality — for example, riders may be transported to the future to save the world from aliens. And they can even fire virtual weapons in what Samsung is touting as the “first-ever interactive gameplay technology on a roller coaster.”</p><p>“This remarkable technology is a definite game-changer for theme park rides and represents everything our brand stands for—delivering the most thrilling and innovative rides and attractions in the world,” said John Duffey, Six Flags President and CEO.&nbsp;</p><p>“What makes this partnership so compelling for consumers and the broader tech industry alike is that both companies are committed to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible – and bringing a VR coaster to life is certainly a new and thrilling proposition,” said Marc Mathieu, chief marketing officer at Samsung Electronics America.</p><p>My verdict? If you're already lining up to experience a roller coaster, then definitely give the VR experience a try, especially if you are already a keen gamer. VR and AR are the future of entertainment, so get ready to strap in and ride.</p><blockquote tml-render-layout="inline"></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Is Pepper The Future Of Companionship And Customer Service?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was fortunate to meet Pepper at Mobile World Congress a few weeks ago in Barcelona. Pepper is a personable robot created by <a href="http://www.softbank.jp/">SoftBank</a>, one of Japan’s biggest telecommunications companies, in collaboration with its subsidiary, the Paris-based humanoid robotics experts <a href="https://www.aldebaran.com/en">Aldebaran</a>.

To be accurate, I met with a couple of Pepper robots. The first was rather unresponsive and ended up going to sleep, with its head down like a child. The second struggled a little with the crowd scenario of a massive conference and had some difficulty focusing its attention on me.

Pepper is a robot designed for human interaction. He can recognize faces, speak, hear, and move around autonomously. He understands basic human emotions, like happiness and sadness. He can identify speech, inflections and tones in our voices and use these to determine whether his human is in a good or a bad mood. He can also learn from his interactions, as his 25 sensors and cameras provide detailed information about the environment and people it interacts with.

But Pepper is not a functional robot for domestic use. Instead,he's intended to make people happy - to enhance people's lives, facilitate relationships, have fun with people and connect them to the outside world. Pepper can replicate body language, and amused me with an enthusiastic dance to "The Locomotion."

<figure><img class=" wp-image-137132631304250960 aligncenter" src="https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTM3MTMyNjI5MTU2NzAxNzc5-225x300.jpg" alt="2016-02-23 13.08.26.jpg" width="513" height="683" /> <figcaption>Pepper dancing</figcaption></figure>Pepper looks directly at you and follows your movements once you’ve attracted his attention, focusing much more readily than many of the humans you likely encounter in your daily interactions. Pepper enjoyed being touched on the head, saying each time "ooh, it tickles!"

But perhaps Pepper's most interesting capacities are in his personalisation. Pepper comes equipped with a tablet and <a href="https://store.aldebaran.com/">corresponding apps</a> can give him the ability to play, learn or chat in multiple languages. There are games, counselling apps, intelligence tests and recipes to name a few.

As Aurore Chiquot, Aldebaran's communications director, explained:
<blockquote>"The robot evolves with you. Pepper gradually memorizes your personality traits, your preferences, and adapts himself to your tastes and habits."</blockquote>
Since Pepper's launch in June 2o15, monthly batches of 1,000 Pepper robots have sold out within a minute every time. Business customers pay $20,000 for a single Pepper, which includes three years of service. Consumers pay half as much, but do not have access to the business functions.  Already, over 7,000 Japanese families have Pepper robots living inside their homes.

I felt like interacting with Pepper was like interacting with a young, wilful child. Questions had to be repeated. It was difficult to hold his attention. Although he could "high five," his jointed hands could not grasp objects. He tired easily. I'm not sure he would provide any emotional needs I do not already get from my cat.

<strong>Business applications for Pepper</strong>

Businesses have been keep to adopt Pepper in customer service functions, primarily in Japan. They help people at train stations in France, providing information and direction on trains, recording customer satisfaction and providing informtion on big events in the area causing longer wait times and crowds at the ticket offices. In Spain and France, they work in department stores, highlighting products and providing directions.

More than 2,000 Peppers have been employed in SoftBank Mobile stores in Japan to welcome, inform and amuse their customers. In January, Softbank <a href="http://dime.jp/genre/237257/1/">announced</a> plans to launch a cellphone store staffed primarily by Pepper robots in Tokyo's Omotesando luxury shopping strip in late March for a week, with humans only on hand to help with the customer identity verification process.

<strong>What's next for Pepper?</strong>

There's already a great <a href="https://community.aldebaran.com/en/developerprogram#section2">developer program</a> for those wanting to personalise their own Pepper. But this will be further expanded as <a href="https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/48763.wss">IBM recently</a> announced plans to develop a version of Watson for Pepper robots. The Watson-powered Pepper robot under development would be equipped with core functionalities as well as a Watson software development kit that allows developers and clients to tailor the interaction experience. IBM will give clients access to Watson APIs and various pre-packaged applications designed to address a variety of personal and professional needs.

A fuller expansion of Pepper retail in Europe is planned for 2016, as well as a future American introduction - starting with businesses - according to <a href="https://www.aldebaran.com/en">Aldebaran</a>, although they remained tight-lipped about exactly when.]]></content:encoded>

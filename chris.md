I am Chris Ward (aka Chris Chinchilla). I am a technical writer, blogger, artist, video/audio maker and presenter who loves to explain cool tech to the World.

After 15 years as a developer I realized that my skills lie in helping others understand technical subjects. I achieve this through technical writing, blogging, networking and educating people through presentations and workshops.

I have crazy projects in progress and will speak to anyone who listens.

Below you can find my latest writing and appearances or contact me through a multitude of networks.

**Why do you call yourself Chris Chinchilla?** Yes it does sound silly doesn't it! It's a nickname I've had since 1997 after a passing comment at school, I've carried it through all my fanzine and music years and like it. For those who are interested, a Chinchilla is a small (and cute) [South American rodent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinchilla), a [Small Town in Queensland, Australia and is a real name in South America.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinchilla,_Queensland)

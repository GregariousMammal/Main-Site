nexpaq is a company making the world's first modular smart phone cases and power packs to enable people to use IoT sensors on their phone as easily as pushing a button. I work there as an in house journalist and writer, undertaking a range of tasks including writing blog posts, press releases, event invitations and managing facebook page.

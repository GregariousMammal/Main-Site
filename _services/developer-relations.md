excerpt: Are you looking to better communicate a technical product to a developer audience? I can help.
---

After 15 years working as a developer I came to the realisation that I was better at explaining and communicating technical topics and offer my services for one-off, short-term or on-going contracts.

Here's how I can help you get the message you want to the audience you need.

## Presentations
Looking for someone to present your technology at a conference, meetup, webinar or private event? I am happy to write and submit talk proposals, learn what needs to be said, craft an engaging presentation and deliver it to a room full of people.

## Demos and Example Code
I can create demos and example code to demonstrate the features of your product or project in real world and understandable context.

## Meetups, Code Sprints and Hack Events
Looking to run a meetup, code sprint or other community event? I can help with everything that needs to happen to make this a reality. Including finding venues, speakers, catering, running the event on the night and handling post-event feedback and communication with participants.

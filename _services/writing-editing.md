After creating a great technical product, people need to understand how best to use it. I can help your potential users and you in several ways and offer my services for one-off, short-term or on-going contracts.

## Technical Writing and Editing
Do you need full documentation written or for someone to review and polish what your team produces? I am happy to tackle whatever you need.

## Blog Posts and Tutorials
Are you looking for contributions to your blog or guest posts to another blog explaining in a few words how your technology works and why people should know about it? I can help.

## Video and Audio
If you're looking for something more than words then I am happy to help. I can produce and edit screencasts, webinars, podcasts or anything else you might be looking for.

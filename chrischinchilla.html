    <div class="description">
      <p>I am Chris Ward (aka Chris Chinchilla). I am a Developer, Writer, and full of crazy ideas.</p>

      <p>After 15 years as a developer I realized that my skills lie in helping others understand technical subjects. I achieve this through technical writing, blogging, networking and educating people through presentations and workshops.</p>

      <p>This site is the home of my personal and work projects and the experiences I have working on them. If you like what you see, read more, come and see me present, or support what I do.</p>

      <p class="smallText"><strong>Why do you call yourself Chris Chinchilla?</strong> Yes it does sound silly doesn’t it! It’s a nickname I’ve had since 1997 after a passing comment at school, I’ve carried it through all my fanzine and music years and like it. For those who are interested, a Chinchilla is a small (and very cute) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinchilla">South American rodent</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinchilla,_Queensland">Small Town in Queensland, Australia and is a real name in South America.</a></p>

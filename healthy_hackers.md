#Healthy Hackers

## Catering for small tech events
###Why healthy hackers?

_Tired of pizza?_

We get it. You're running an event and you want something a bit more interesting than pizza. You might have a function room or be using a backroom at a co-working space.  You want something that's healthy but tasty as pizza and can be enjoyed by everyone. But you don't want anything fussy.

Your attendees have people to meet and greet and business cards in the back of their pockets. They don't want to have to use a plate or a knife and fork. They want to enjoy the bar and take a few pics and post a few tweets whilst eating.

 We make it easy with one handed healthy snacks that are easy to enjoy. We know your events and your audience.

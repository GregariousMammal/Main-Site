An ever growing miscellaneous list of travel tips and thoughts that occur to me. These are about travel itself, not my actual travels.<ul><li>After flying international, getting low cost flights for remainder of the journey isn&#39;t worth it.</li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Don&#39;t always go for the cheapest option for transfers etc, often not worth it the long run.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">British airports suck and so do most of the associated services, they have some of the worst customer service around.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Going off the beaten track is worthwhile.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Hotels are the past, airbnb is the future.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Being an English speaker is an amazing luxury when traveling.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">There is a gap in the market for a decent travelers sim card with good data. <a href="http://www.lebara.com.au/" target="_blank">Lebra</a>, and <a href="http://uros.com/" target="_blank">Uros</a> come close, but still not quite, please let me know if you know of anything better available in Australia.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Is it me or do airlines not want to give away add much alcohol as they used to?</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">One travel power adapter is rarely enough.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>

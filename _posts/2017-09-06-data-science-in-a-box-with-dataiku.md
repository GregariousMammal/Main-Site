Data science is the new hotness, with thousands of job postings (some of which really aren’t data science), to dozens of platforms promising to help professionals in the field do their job more effectively. In typical fashion, not all these tools are new, but re-purposed for new use cases, with tools such as Python, R, and Hadoop experiencing new surges in interest thanks to the ‘new’ field of Data Science. One of the most well conceived and cohesive tools I’ve seen is Dataiku. It aims to package together all the tools that a data scientist and the teams that work with them might need in one application.

<p>I don&#39;t seem to the only one noticing that whilst the mainstream rock circles are getting progressively louder, fuzzier and dischordant, there&#39;s an increasing amount of fantastic mellower more subtle artists rapidly appearing on the scene. This is an excellently compiled album featuring tracks from the likes of Dan Sartain, Simon Breed and Gemma Ray that all contribute to creating a well balanced and superb compilation for those wanting something a little quieter, but by no means calmer, alternative to the noise that the kids are making.</p><p><a href="http://www.bronzerat.co.uk" target="_blank">www.bronzerat.co.uk</a></p><p>Published in Maps Magazine</p>

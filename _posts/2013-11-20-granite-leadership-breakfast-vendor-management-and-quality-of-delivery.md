title: Granite Leadership breakfast - Vendor Management & Quality of Delivery
created: 1384941483
---


<span>First up, I find it strange how different sectors describe the same things with different names and have the same problems. It&#39;s simultaneously refreshing and depressing that small and large organisations have exactly the same problems with their projects.</span>

<strong><span>Small or large, what is the fundamental problem?</span></strong><br />&nbsp;

<em>Here&#39;s my bullet point thoughts on the breakfast</em><ul><li><span>Vendor management = project management etc</span></li><li><span>Deliver more that you promise, not the other way around</span></li><li><span>Beware of a lack of skills on customer side</span></li><li><span>Get yes in writing</span></li><li><span>Involvement from all, agile principles</span></li><li><span>Uniqueness of supplier and contractors, even if requirements are the same</span></li><li><span>Document the need for any specialists</span></li><li><span>What do vendors get out of a project,&nbsp; treat them as partners. Understand your Vendor, their strengths and weaknesses.</span></li><li><span>What role does a contract have in a project?&nbsp; A stick, a backup, legalise, scope of project? Or are they too meaningless and vague.</span></li><li><span>Measurements, but also what actions will happen as a result of certain measurements.</span></li><li><span>What is the chain of command</span></li><li><span>Have key kpis in contracts</span></li><li><span>What is the internal hiring process and ethics of vendors,&nbsp; especially if relying on a resident specialist.</span></li><li><span>Spend some time with those who will be working on you project.</span></li><li><span>Ask for pieces of the project, screenshots, tests</span></li></ul>

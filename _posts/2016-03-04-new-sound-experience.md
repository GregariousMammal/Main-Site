excerpt: Israeli firm's next-gen human-machine vocal interface goes straight to your
  ears   - without any hardware IN your ears
---
It's not that often that you witness a product demonstration that
absolutely blows your mind. But at last week's Mobile World Congress,
Israeli company Noveto Systems did just that. They are developing the
next-generation of human-machine vocal interface, enabling
sound-emitting devices to transmit sound beams to the user's ears only,
without any external hardware on the user.

How Noveto's interface works

It's a combination of cameras and sensors that track the user’s head,
using positional 3D face tracking along with wave-shaping algorithms and
special transducers that send a focused audio beam into each ear.
Through this use of face tracking, Noveto can change where the beam of
audio is aimed or fire out multiple beams to people sitting next to each
other on a sofa.  

I tried it using a dock connected to a mobile phone. It's a strange
sensation when the sound suddenly hits your ears - not at all painful or
uncomfortable but crystal clear. Skeptical, I also made one of the
Noveto management team do the demo, and yes, I could not hear anything!
It was nothing short of amazing.

I can see loads of applications for the Noveto - watching TV without
disturbing a partner sitting next to you. For gamers, Noveto can also
beam separate audio tracks to individual users, so you could have a
split-screen game where each player hears something different. It can
also provide higher volume for someone hearing-impaired. The technology
could just as easily have applications in personal computing, IoT and
automobiles.

Now you won't drive her crazy in bed

Noveto believes this technology will be available commercially in the
next twelve months, most likely through partnering with a bigger brand.
It's definitely one to keep an eye on - it could change sound as we know
it.

  Potato salad is something that is lovely if it&#8217;s made well. This recipe uses some of my favourite ingredients: crunchy pickles, juicy baby peas, creamy avocado and chipotle chilli flakes. It&#8217;s easy to put together and challenges the idea that potato salad has to be soaked with oil or full of cream, eggs or mayonnaise. You want to make the dressing just before serving to preserve the freshness of the avocado.

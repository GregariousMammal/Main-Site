<p>I&#39;ve been using buffer for ages, but not got around to writing anything about it, so now I met appear to be following the pack somewhat.</p><p>I go through phases of having time to read through news and blogs, generally with a few days between opportunities. So I&#39;ll find a bunch of articles and links I want to share across one or more social networks but don&#39;t really want to share, say 20 at once. Enter buffer. It allows you to &#39;buffer&#39; (or post immediately) several social shares across your networks and even set the times they should go out for maximum effect or just some space in between.</p><p>It currently works with Facebook (personal and pages), twitter, LinkedIn and app.net, provides analytics on your posts, has some pretty solid mobile apps and browser plugins and is free for a limited amount of posts and accounts that should suit most non social media professionals, I like it so much I might even upgrade to premium despite not needing to.</p><p><a href="http://bufferapp.com" target="_blank">bufferapp.com</a></p>

<p>Sorry, this is horrible, bloody disco beats all over the place for no real reason, stupid inane lyrics about taping a TV program and irritating Xylophone plastered over the top of some horrendously recorded tinny guitars. It&#39;s not a bad song, it has a catchy chorus, I&#39;d just like to take the band, rearrange the song, strip it down and rerecord the whole thing to make the hooks audible and less grating.</p><p><a href="http://www.winterkidsmusic.com" target="_blank">www.winterkidsmusic.com</a></p><p>Published in Maps Magazine</p>

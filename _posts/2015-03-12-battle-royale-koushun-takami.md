<p>In my continued efforts to read as mazy works of dystopian fiction as possible, next on my list was Battle Royale. On a side note, are there many works of purely utopian fiction? Or would that not sell? Back to the east Asian republic. Set in the non-too-distant future, a large Asian empire now rules over an undefined area, full of social control, aggression and suppression. Once a term a class of school children are chosen to compete in a battle to the death on an abandoned island with no hope of escape and only one survivor. It&#39;s never completely clear why this happens and what the government gets out of it, but that doesn&#39;t matter too much.</p><p>Initially the book is slightly hard to read, firstly due to it being translated and secondly due to the littering of cultural references you&#39;re unsure if you&#39;re missing due to being lost in translation or if they are intentionally misleading. The violence is sometimes grim, but its bearable, only crossing the line a handful of times. That said, I found it far easier to read during the day than before going to bed.</p><p>Eventually you settle into the style and it becomes a riveting read, especially the last section of the book as it draws to a conclusion.</p><p>There are several twists I didn&#39;t see coming and plenty of exploration of the human psyche and the pointlessness of totalitarianism to keep you hooked if you are not a lover of the violent aspects.</p><p>All in all, worth pushing through some of the odd language for a highly focussed work of dystopian shlock.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1421527723/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1421527723&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gregamamma-20&amp;linkId=ANPGF5DGA4HJTLZB">Want to earn me a few cents?

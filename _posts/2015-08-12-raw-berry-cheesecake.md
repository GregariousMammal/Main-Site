I would have take a photo of the whole cheesecake but it was eaten before this was possible!

_Variations:_

You can vary the topping with different fruits or chocolate, add cacao and peppermint (like in my [chocolate peppermint torte](http://atravellingcook.com/2014/12/chocolate-peppermint-torte.html)) or orange zest or coffee to the filling or use dates instead of coconut in the crust for a change. I&#8217;ve made it loads of times and it always is incredibly popular.

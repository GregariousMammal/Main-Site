excerpt: Look out for the consumer version's April release
---
Vayyar, a 3D imaging sensor company *–* with technology making it
possible to see through objects, liquids and materials *–* announced the
launch of Walabot last week, a consumer version of its 3D imaging
system.

Walabot’s powerful sensor technology can look through walls to detect
structural foundations, track a person’s location and vital signs as
they move through a smart home, measure the speed of a fast moving ball,
and help drones and cars avoid collisions. 

The product's capabilities have been described as akin to Superman x-ray
vision and I was excited to meet with Raviv Melamed, Vayyar's CEO and
co-founder, at Mobile World Congress this week.  

Vayyar's initial foray into sensor technology centred around breast
cancer screening. Melamed explained:  

*\
"More than 40% of insured woman in the United States don't conduct early
stage breast cancer screenings – an astonishing number given these tests
are routine and often covered by insurance policies. Our vision with
Vayyar is that woman won't need to go to special screening clinics for
mammograms performed in big, bulky and uncomfortable machines and
instead, can use Vayyar at their regular check-up appointment. Vayyar is
safe, portable, compact, light, and most importantly, inexpensive. As
such, Vayyar can also be used in countries with limited medical
resources." *

But it soon becomes clear that Vayyar's 3D imaging capabilities extended
beyond breast cancer detection devices as Melamed discussed: 

*\
"We originally created Vayyar sensors to detect early stage breast
cancer, but we quickly realized how powerful our technology was and how
useful it could be in other industries. Because our sensors can be used
in nearly every scenario where non-destructive testing and the ability
to detect different anomalies in an object is needed, it can be used in
multiple use cases across many different industries."  *

Walabot's new sensor

"*Walabot can help the blind avoid obstacles, sense – and alert you – if
your mother or father has fallen in the shower, help your robot become
autonomous and much more."*

Walabot will launch soon and Melamed hopes for big things:

*"It'll be interesting to see what makers, curious inventors and
innovators around the world create when we release our API to the public
in April. The power of Vayyar's 3D sensor is truly special, and this
community will have a great time discovering its potential. When Walabot
launches in April, the product will ship with a Vayyar-created app in
addition to a community-created app that people around the world can
enjoy." *

Walabot will range in price from \$99 to \$599 and is currently
available for preorder. This is going change 3D technology as we know it
and is definitely one to watch.

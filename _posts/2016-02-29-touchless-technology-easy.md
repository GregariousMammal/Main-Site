excerpt: New gesture control technology available to mobile industry
---
[Elliptic Labs](http://www.ellipticlabs.com/) has been passionate about
gesture-controlled technology since its founding in 2006. While much of
their energy has been focused on a touch-free mobile phone experience -
enabling hands-free video recording and selfies - they unveiled EASY IoT
software at Mobile World Congress, allowing controlling IoT appliances
to take place with simple hand gestures. The technology can be
applicable to devices like smart thermostats, kitchen appliances,
lighting controls, and security systems, to name a few.

The company will be offering EASY IoT technology to mobile manufacturers
for inclusion in their products. “By working closely with mobile
manufacturers and their IoT innovation departments, we enable consumers
to easily connect, control, and interact with IoT devices,” explained
Laila Danielsen, CEO of Elliptic Labs. “Ultrasound is such a versatile
yet robust technology that creating solutions for home use, as we are
demoing today, is just the beginning."

EASY IoT works by using ultrasonic presence-detection to wake up devices
and enable touchless gesture capabilities. When a device detects the
presence of a hand or body, it turns itself to waiting or active mode,
ready to be used. The technology can be embedded in any device and OEMs
can assign any meaning to a gesture depending on the application and the
location where the gesture is performed.

Available exclusively from Elliptic Labs, ultrasonic touchless gesture
technology has already proven itself superior to other approaches, such
as optical or infrared sensors. Ultrasonic technology is the only such
solution that can deliver full 3D interaction all around a device at 180
degrees. The exceptionally wide interaction zone, together with low
power consumption and functionality in any lighting conditions, make
ultrasound a winning technology for tomorrow’s connected home.

The revolutionary ultrasound technology from Elliptic Labs works much
like radar, sending out sound waves that bounce off objects and deliver
back information via microphones built into existing devices. Elliptic
Labs’ software converts this information into a command for the mobile
device or IoT appliance. Does the gesture controlling look strange?
Perhaps, at first, but once you've demoed switching a lamp on and off
with a gesture and learn that the small sensors use very little battery
power, you start to believe that this could change the lives of not only
devices but also their users.

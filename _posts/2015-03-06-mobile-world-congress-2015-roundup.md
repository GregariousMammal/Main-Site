The mobile monolith that is Mobile World Congress is over for another year. I was lucky enough to get hold of a press pass and decided to spend the week in Barcelona. Soaking up the warmer weather, joining the 90,000 other attendees and preparing for the bombardment of marketing mumbo jumbo to unearth some gems for developers.

MWC is mainly about hardware, from smaller commercial devices including phones, wearables and selfie sticks(!) to enterprise and infrastructure hardware. Whilst hardware may interest a lot of SitePoint readers, it's not really what we cover, so I am focussing on a select list of companies, projects and ideas that I found. There was of course a lot more, some of which I saw and quite a lot I missed, it's a very big event.

The Fades return after a 6-month hiatus, refreshed and rewritten, their Modish riffage doesn?∆í√ôt fit into the modern scene but I doubt they care. They are also at a distinct advantage that their new material is as good if not better than their older material, leaving some of the old favourites sounding a little tired and getting better crowd reactions. The Fades are back, long live the Fades.

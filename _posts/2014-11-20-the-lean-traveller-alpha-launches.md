I have just rolled it the first incarnation of <a href="http://theleantraveller.com/" target="_blank">The Lean Traveller</a>, with the first of the topics we will be covering, &#39;<a href="http://theleantraveller.com/money" target="_blank">Money</a>&#39;. We have the&nbsp;beginnings&nbsp;of a theme and structure, but there&#39;s much more to come&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;next month:<ul><li>Adding images</li><li>Ratings and Cost comparisons</li><li>More Content</li><li>Project Management workflow behind the scenes for handling contacting services we cover.</li><li>More topics and content</li></ul>

This was a reasonably easy initial rollout, the only complications being that we are utilising&nbsp;Drupal&#39;s<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/domain" target="_blank">&nbsp;Domain module</a> to handle&nbsp;centralising&nbsp;content amongst all our project sites whilst also feeding it out&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;appropriate&nbsp;project site. This has required some fiddling, but we have got there now!

](atc-migrate/2015/08/DSC0550.jpg) I started making coconut bacon back in Australia as an alternative to the pig derived stuff. I&#8217;m a big fan of [liquid smoke](http://atravellingcook.com/2015/01/vegan-ingredients-resource-list.html) and I love the smoky, sweet, salty flavour that coconut bacon imparts. Use it where you would use bacon- mixed through pasta or salad, a top a baked potato, in a sandwich, it&#8217;s delicious!

My bacon is quite dark as I like to make sure it is quite crisp and I also use dark ingredients like 

[liquid smoke](http://atravellingcook.com/2015/01/vegan-ingredients-resource-list.html) and tamari. You can of course cook it little less!


  <i>Ingredients:</i>


<li class="p2">
  2 cup large flake, unsweetened coconut
</li>
<li class="p2">
  1 tablespoon liquid smoke
</li>
<li class="p2">
  2 tablespoons tamari
</li>
<li class="p2">
  1 tablespoon water
</li>
<li class="p2">
  1 tablespoon maple syrup or agave
</li>


  <i>Instructions: </i>


<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li2">
    Combine ingredients together. mix and make sure the coconut is evenly coated.
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    Heat fry pan to a low heat
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    Add coconut and cook until crisp, you ideally want some softer bits and some darker crunchy bits. It will continue to crisp as it cools.
  </li>
</ol>

title: Changes From Play Testing
date: '2015-11-16'

After my first very constructive play test session, here is the first wave of changes to the game.

## Changing 'Personalities' to 'Staff'
People felt that the word 'Personality' was too strong and placed too much emphasis on the historical figures over the generic staff members. One fantastic idea was that these 'generic' staff cards could become kickstarter backers in the future and thus give people the chance to also be a 'Personality'.

This change also helps clear up the mixed use of the _staff_ resource exhanged for a _personality_ card, they are now both the same.

## Updating 'Bankruptcy' concept
In reality businesses go bankrupt all the time and this doesn't stop their founders starting new ones. As it's easy to run out of money in Chip Shop, players felt there needed to be a better way of allowing players who go bankrupt an opportunity to continue in the game. By allowing bankrupt players to start again but keep their loyalty scores and certain other cards reflects the boom and bust cycles of celebrities in Silicon Valley, so was a simple but effective change.

## Money piles for tracking income
I was always a little unclear on how to track how much money and for how long a card brings income to a player. One play tester by chance hit upon the great idea of adding piles of money split into the quantity and number of turns that can be removed each turn. Another simple but effective solution.

## Accessory Tweaks

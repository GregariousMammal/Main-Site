I&#8217;ve read quite a lot of recipes which use black beans as an alternative to flour in making brownies. I find the taste of black beans (and kidney beans) is too overpowering in baking from past experience so I used white (aka navy) beans instead. When you drain the beans, save the brine, you can use it to make vegan [meringues](http://atravellingcook.com/2015/05/egg-free-meringues.html) or [lemon butter](http://atravellingcook.com/2015/05/egg-free-lemon-butter.html) or even vegan [dumplings](http://atravellingcook.com/2015/08/egg-free-potato-dumplings.html)!

This recipe makes quite a squigy type of brownie that is fudgy and chocolately and good! They bake quite dark so they aren&#8217;t the easiest to photograph but they are delicious.

  <ol>
    <li class="instruction">
      Preheat oven to 180 degrees celcius (350 degrees fahrenheit). Line a loaf tin with baking paper leaving some overhanging longer bits on the sides. These will make it easier to remove the brownies when they are cool.
    </li>
    <li class="instruction">
      In a blender or food processor, puree the all of the ingredients, scraping down the sides and stirring regularly. Add a little water as needed as you are aiming for a smooth batter.
    </li>
    <li class="instruction">
      Adjust the cacao and sugar as needed. I find this is often about personal taste!
    </li>
    <li class="instruction">
      Stir well and spoon batter into the pan using a spatula or wooden spoon.
    </li>
    <li class="instruction">
      Smooth over the top of the batter to be relatively even.
    </li>
    <li class="instruction">
      Bake at 180 degrees for about 45-60 minutes. They may seem a bit soft in the middle but this is good as it means they will be fudgy when they cool.
    </li>
    <li class="instruction">
       Cool completely in pan, then lift the whole brownie out by pulling up on the edges of the parchment paper.
    </li>
    <li class="instruction">
      Transfer to a chopping board and slice using a very sharp knife.
    </li>
  </ol>

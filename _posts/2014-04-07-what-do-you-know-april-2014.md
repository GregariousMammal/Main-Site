<strong>Innovating the open source business model, Shane from Silverstripe</strong><br /><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Both client and developers want more for less. All open source communities say their advantage is the size of their community, the amount of modules they have and that everyone is using it. That&#39;s what the others say... So Silverstripe do the opposite. Open Source vs proprietary, how do you differentiate, that&#39;s the new argument. Personally, Silverstripe seem to offer similar things to other communities really, do they support developers who don&#39;t work for them? Warranties etc aren&#39;t anything new. premium support etc.</span>

<strong>Bikeshedding - Drew from reactive</strong><br /><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Clients often miss the big details and focus on small things like logo and colours. You need to feel the confidence to say &quot;I know what I&#39;m doing, I&#39;m an expert&quot;. Websites are hard projects. Why do clients do this? A loss of control, scared, &nbsp;they don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on, help them through the process.</span>

There was a panel discussion at tonight&#39;s launch but it was really all about launching Victoria&#39;s peak body for startups, entrepreneurs and founders tonight and the packed room was very much in drinking and talking mode.

That there is enough happening in the Melbourne and Victorian startup scene to warrant a peak body is fantastic and it&#39;s great to know that the state Government along side several corporates are backing Startup Victoria.

Join in April or May and get membership for $99, which includes a plethora of freebies as well as supporting Victoria&#39;s great ideas.

Slightly late on my yearly roundup, which was the catchphrase of the year for me. I'm not quite sure where 2018 went, to be honest, I had so many plans, then it was halfway through the year, then it was over. One of my resolutions for 2019 is to make sure I have more time for personal and creative projects. Which I think I also said last year üò≠.

All in all, it was a good year, and I worked for a lot of interesting projects, which explains the lack of time. I travelled a little too much, but visited interesting places, and met interesting people. I was disappointed in myself for not finishing some of my creative projects, and am doubling down to complete a few more in 2019.

As part of this plan, I am rebranding and rejigging what I do. This includes:

- Switching my Gregarious Mammal presence to be a pure tech writing agency, and no longer use it as my creative vehicle.
- My Chris Chinchilla presence will be reborn as my hub for creative projects, talks, blogs with my name on, and podcasts.
- Speaking of podcasts, I am shuttering the Gregarious Mammal podcast and splitting into some new shows:

  - Bringing back the weekly squeak news show that will tie tightly with my weekly newsletter.
  - Starting two new shows, one called "The Enthusiastic Amateur", one based on "The Boardgame Jerk" bot I have.
  - The Write the Docs show will continue and I may merge some of the interviews into a DZone podcast.

- My newsletter will assume it's regular weekly schedule inline with the podcast, and I am also launching two new automated newsletters:

  - One covering Tech Ethics with Nicholas Borsotto.
  - One covering "language", NLP, voice interfaces, interactive fiction and more.

- My planned creative projects are:

  - A book on improving tech.
  - Expanding the Boardgame Jerk bot.
  - A Geek vs. Geek card game.
  - An anonymous blog. I can't tell you what it is, as that would spoil things üòÅ.
  - One shot RPG scenarios based on my "One Day the World Ended" project.
  - Finishing the "One Day the World Ended" card game, that will tie into the RPG.

    - A bunch of other interactive fiction wotsits.

- Oh, and a whole set of open source contributions of course.

But what happened in 2018 ü§î?

## Writing

{% assign 2018posts = site.posts | where:"date","2018" | where:"categories","Chris" %}

In 2018, I wrote approximately **{{ 2018posts.size }}** articles, blog posts, and tutorials. In addition to this I contributed documentation to IPFS, Solidity, Plasma MVP, Vale, Event Store, Facebook Messenger, and probably a bunch more I've forgottens.

The most popular on my Medium account were:

- [Tutorial: Using the Messenger Webview to create richer bot-to-user interactions](https://blog.messengerdevelopers.com/using-the-webview-to-create-richer-bot-to-user-interactions-ed8a789523c6)
- [Making Atom (even more) awesome -- My Setup](https://hackernoon.com/making-atom-even-more-awesome-my-setup-e7a89969a876)
- [A documentation crash course for developers](https://hackernoon.com/a-documentation-crash-course-45006a85c15c)

Most popular on DZone were:

- [What Apple's September Announcements Might Mean for Developers](https://dzone.com/articles/what-apples-september-announcements-might-mean-for)
- [Why Programmers Should Play Boardgames](https://dzone.com/articles/why-programmers-should-play-boardgames)
- [Will Linux (Finally) Win the Desktop War Because No One Else Cares?s](https://dzone.com/articles/will-linux-finally-win-the-desktop-war-because-no)

## Video and audio

{% assign 2018podcast = site.posts | where:"type","podcast" %}

I created **{{ 2018podcast.size }}** podcast episodes, and the most popular were:

- [Stefan Thomas, ripple and Malta blockchain summit](https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e1vp20)
- [Creative Industries on the Blockchain - Zach LeBeau of SingularDTV](https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e175or)
- [Ben Goertzel of SingularityNET and Hanson Robotics](https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e2podg)

Proving that Blockchain people love podcasts!

I created a video course for Manning called "[CSS in Depth](https://livevideo.manning.com/course/25/css-in-depth-in-motion)", which took a lot of work!

## Presentations and Conferences

{% assign 2018events = site.events | where:"date","2018" %} I spoke at, or reported on approximately **{{2018events.size}}** conferences and meetups, not including the roughly 2 a week I attend in Berlin on a regular basis.

**According to Google (including personal travel) this included 26 airports, 267 places, 50 cities and 17 countries. Just over 100,000km.**

That was a little too many, and in 2019 I am going to be more focused on which events I attend.

It's been a bad period for Canada's Standard Innovation Corp., with the
news that their popular connected "pleasure device" (aka a
vibrator...now everyone settle down), We Vibe 4 Plus, is easily hackable
being followed by a corresponding lawsuit.

The smart vibrator released two years ago is marketed towards couples
spending time apart. It's Bluetooth - and Wi-Fi - compatible and able to
be controlled remotely by either partner using a cellphone app called
We-Connect. This allows users to control the toy’s intensity and
vibration patterns. Other features built into the app include private
text messages and video calls.

At the latest [DefCon](https://www.defcon.org/) conference held in
August in Las Vegas,  two independent hackers from New Zealand, known
digitally as [goldfisk](https://twitter.com/g0ldfisk){.u-underline} and
[follower](https://twitter.com/rancidbacon){.u-underline}, presented a
talk titled "Hacking the Internet of Vibrating Things" that revealed
that the ways  that the way the vibrator connects with its controlling
app isn’t secure – making it possible to remotely seize control of the
vibrator and activate it at will.

***See also:** [That connected device already knows your mom's maiden
name](https://readwrite.com/2016/10/13/wombat-securitys-cto-offers-security-advice-to-consumers-dl4/)*

The pair also discovered that the app itself was sending the temperature
of the device back to Standard Innovation every minute, and any time the
intensity of the vibration changed - - in effect providing data of when
and how often someone is using the vibrator.

This data is stored on corporate servers and in the terms and conditions
of the device the manufacturer reserves the right to pass it on to the
authorities. “What are the implications of who they’re going to give
that data to,” asked goldfisk. “In their privacy policy, they say ‘we
reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information
if required to by law’, but what does that actually mean?”\

A new form of sexual assault?
-----------------------------

While some may at first find the concept amusing, the reality is
that the security of a sex toy should be taken seriously. As goldfisk
commented during the talk:

> “The company that makes this vibrator, Standard Innovation: They have
> over 2 million people using their devices, so what’s at stake is 2
> million people...A lot of people in the past have said it’s not really
> a serious issue, but if you come back to the fact that we’re talking
> about people, unwanted activation of a vibrator is potentially sexual
> assault.”

In a
[statement](http://we-vibe.com/blog/our-commitment-to-customer-privacy-and-security/)
in response to the workshop, Standard Innovation shared that they have
engaged external security and privacy experts to conduct a thorough
review of our data practices with a view of further strengthening data
protection for our customers. They admit to this data collection, too:

> "We do collect certain limited data to help us improve our products
> and for diagnostic purposes. As a matter of practice, we use this data
> in an aggregate, non-identifiable form. Processor chip temperature is
> used to help us determine whether device processors are operating
> correctly. And vibration intensity data is used for the purposes of
> helping us better understand how—in the aggregate—our product features
> are utilized."

In September a Canadian woman known only as N.P in an [18-page class
action](http://Going%20only%20by%20her%20initials%20in%20the%2018-page%20class%20action,%20N.P.%20says%20she%20bought%20herself%20a%20$130%20We-Vibe%20from%20an%20Illinois%20retailer%20this%20past%20May.%20She%20used%20it%20several%20times%20then%20but%20never%20realized%20%22that%20We-Connect%20monitors%20and%20records,%20in%20real%20time,%20how%20they%20use%20the%20device,%22%20according%20to%20the%20Sept.%202%20complaint.%20Standard%20Innovation%20likewise%20failed%20to%20mention,%20the%20complaint%20continues,%20%22that%20it%20transmits%20the%20collected%20private%20usage%20information%20to%20its%20servers%20in%20Canada.%22)
lodged a civil suit against Standard Innovation. She says she bought
herself a \$130 We-Vibe from an Illinois retailer in May but never
realized "that We-Connect monitors and records, in real time, how they
use the device."

Standard Innovation likewise failed to mention "that it transmits the
collected private usage information to its servers in Canada."

Standard Innovation released
a[statement](http://we-vibe.com/blog/we-connect-app-and-privacy-update/)
this week that they have updated the We-Connect app and app privacy
notice. This includes an option for customers to opt-out of sharing
anonymous app usage data is available in the We-Connect settings and
a new plain language [Privacy
Notice](http://we-vibe.com/we-connect-privacy) outlining data
collection.

A short history of long breaches
--------------------------------

It's worth noting the world's first smart
vibrator, [Vibease](https://www.vibease.com/), only came on the market
in 2015. Yet it's not the first leak of sensitive data.
At [CeBIT](http://www.cebit.de/home) in Hannover earlier this year,
security software firm [Trend
Micro](http://trendmicro.com/){.dd-link-external} revealed that it was
able to successfully hijack a vibrator that connect to the internet with
an on-stage reveal.

Using a PIN of 0000—the default option for most bluetooth devices—Trend
Micro’s researchers were able to easily connect to the vibrator and
implement its own software to take control over the device.

In 2011 developer [Andy
Baio](https://mobile.twitter.com/waxpancake/status/87364038417330176)
revealed that Fitbit health and activity trackers were revealing users'
sexual activity stats online. The company had made users’ profiles and
activity public by default, to encourage social sharing and friendly
competition. As a consequence, over 200 Fitbit users’ "sex-ercise" were
[showing up in Google search
results](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/07/05/fitbit-moves-quickly-after-users-sex-stats-exposed/#6ac15acb79e7).

Then only recently a [Consumer
Report](http://www.consumerreports.org/mobile-security-software/glow-pregnancy-app-exposed-women-to-privacy-threats/)
into Glow Pregnancy App revealed that private health and sexual
information was easily accessible, even to those without any hacking
skills. Anyone with an account could request that data of another to be
shared without the sharer requiring to supply permission to do so.

This meant that "anyone — loving partner, obsessive ex-husband, or
anonymous creep — could link his account to any Glow users, if he knew
the woman’s email address." Other vulnerabilities would allow an
attacker with rudimentary software tools to collect email addresses,
change passwords, and access personal information from participants in
Glow’s community forums, where people discuss their sex lives and health
concerns.

It's clear that security regulations in both connected devices and
personal health apps need to have greater security measures implemented
that involve "opt in" consent to the sharing of information, along with
penalties for unsafe devices. This needs to be combined with greater
consumer education and a populace that digital devices take their
security seriously in the first instance.

And maybe a really secure safe word.

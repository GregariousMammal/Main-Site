<p>Just a small update, with a much larger one coming next week.</p><p>I have updated and&nbsp;refined&nbsp;the <a href="/manual/costs">costs</a> and <a href="/manual/cards">card</a> concepts of the game. I have also started drafting a manual which ties together the game into a sort or logic and creating the system that I will use (and the public in&nbsp;the&nbsp;future) to create&nbsp;cards.</p><p>All of that will be reported back on next week!</p>

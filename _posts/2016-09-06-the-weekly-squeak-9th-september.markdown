## Reactive Programming (with Swift)

First up was [a Swift meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Dubsmash-Tech-Talks/events/233449942/) covering [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) with a variety of frameworks. Having heard a lot about the subject I was keen to get a more 'bgeinner' perspective of what Reactive programming actually is and how / when it might be useful. The talks were more advanced than I was expecting and I was still missing a starting point, still it was good to see real-world code examples. For those of you interested in an actual 'beginners guide', this [gist](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754) might be what you're looking for.

## Continous Discovery

I am not a product owner (well, not on an official or large scale), but am always interested in learning how products are refined over time, so attended [this Product Tank meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ProductTank-Berlin/events/233351432/). It's a subject that can and should interest anyone involved with a product really. Continous discovery is the part of the continuous development process that involves finding out what users actually want and how they feel about a product. Maybe I was expecting something different from the term, but to me it seemed like what should be part of a typical agile development process. Is it just a new term for an old practice, or a sub-term of an existing process?

One of the things I love most about interviewing the people behind tech projects is coincidentally discovering your subject is a bonafide technology visionary. Brian Behlendorf was one of the key developers behind the Apache Web Server and is a Mozilla and EFF board member, three projects I respect massively. For this interview, we only had time to cover his current role, as Executive Director of the Hyperledger Foundation, a project that aims to bring blockchain mainstream.

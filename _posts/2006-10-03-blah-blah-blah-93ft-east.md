<p>Very rarely does everything come together in a perfect compliment of personalities and musical abilities. Songs full of humour and razor sharp wit entices the audience and the brilliant harmonies, funky bass lines and drums keep them dancing and smiling for the sets&#39; duration. The band leave the stage to rapturous applause and on comes another generic indie band, most of the crowd follow through the door.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.myspace.com/blahblahblahandfriends" target="_blank">www.myspace.com/blahblahblahandfriends</a></p><p>Published in Angry Ape<br />The Cuckoo Press, January 2007<br />Maps Magazine</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">That snazzy website your looking at took a while to make didn&#39;t it? What do you reckon? Maybe it took the developers a few months to make. Perhaps its taken them a few years of iterative development to create and perfect something more complex.</span></p><p>But what about everything else you&#39;re using, ever given any thought on how long they all took to make?</p><p>Did you know that php, the language behind many sites you view was a year in the making before its initial release, mysql, the database engine that holds the data behind most sites has a near twenty year history. The initial versions of HTML and DNS were also a couple of years in the making and most of the web browsers you use have histories running back to the 90s.</p><p>In more recent history, Drupal and WordPress have both been in existance for nearly 12 years and even HTML 5 and CSS 3, the current cutting edge tools we have available to us have been in development for several years.</p><p>So next time you&#39;re browsing that site full of cute cat pictures, connecting with old friends, shopping online or sharing what you just ate for breakfast, remember there&#39;s nearly 30 years of work behind what you&#39;re looking at. show some appreciation.</p><p><small>Image taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet" target="_blank">here</a>, which is a fascinating read.</small></p>

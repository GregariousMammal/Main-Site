excerpt: Israeli firm's next-gen human-machine vocal interface goes straight to your
  ears   - without any hardware IN your ears
---
<p>It's not that often that you witness a product demonstration that absolutely blows your mind. But at last week's Mobile World Congress, Israeli company&nbsp;Noveto Systems&nbsp;did just that. They are developing the next-generation of human-machine vocal interface, enabling sound-emitting devices to transmit&nbsp;sound beams to the user's ears only, without any external hardware on the user.</p>

<p>It's a combination of cameras and sensors that track the userâ€™s head, using positional 3D face tracking along with wave-shaping algorithms and special transducers that send a focused audio beam into each ear. Through this use of&nbsp;face tracking, Noveto can change where the beam of audio is aimed or fire out multiple beams to people sitting next to each other on a sofa. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried it using a dock connected to a mobile phone. It's a strange sensation when the sound suddenly hits your ears   - not at all painful or uncomfortable but crystal clear. Skeptical, I also made one of the Noveto management team do the demo, and yes, I could not hear anything! It was nothing short of amazing.</p>
<p>I can see loads of applications for the Noveto   - watching TV without disturbing a partner sitting next to you. For gamers, Noveto can also beam separate audio tracks to individual users, so you could have a split-screen game where each player hears something different. It can also provide higher volume for someone hearing-impaired. The technology could just as easily have applications in personal computing, IoT and automobiles.</p>

<p>Noveto believes this technology will be available commercially in the next twelve months, most likely through partnering with a bigger brand. It's definitely one to keep an eye on   - it could change sound as we know it. &nbsp;</p>

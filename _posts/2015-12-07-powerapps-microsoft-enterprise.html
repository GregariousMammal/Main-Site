<p>Can you picture your boss building an app? Just as anyone who wields PowerPoint can create a logo, now anyone can build a business app, thanks to Microsoft's new&nbsp;<a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/">PowerApps</a>,&nbsp;a new enterprise service to help workers create apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introduced&nbsp;last week at its annual <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/2015/11/30/microsoft-announces-solutions-to-help-businesses-modernize-in-the-digital-world/">Convergence MEA</a>,&nbsp;Microsoft's Software as a Service (SaaS) PowerApps&nbsp;can also&nbsp;connect&nbsp;to business systems in a secure way and let employees share their apps with coworkers. The service was&nbsp;hinted at in April of this year, thanks to a leaked <a href="http://www.winbeta.org/news/microsoft-mistakenly-reveals-plans-power-apps-new-job-listing-1">job posting</a>&nbsp;seeking developers to create mobile-first, cloud-based apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company's foray into business apps<a href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2015/11/30/introducing-microsoft-powerapps/">&nbsp;appears to be a response</a>&nbsp;to what it cites as a lag in business apps at the expense of personal apps, compounded by a lack of skilled developers, a confusion of business data stored in a range of systems and difficulties getting apps onto employee phones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft designed its app creator to be easy to use, and the apps should work on any device using a Microsoft Office-like experience.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Making Enterprise App-Creation Easy&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Microsoft provides a highly pictorial drag and drop interface including templates for building basic apps with a few clicks. The&nbsp;PowerApps can be connected to&nbsp;cloud services like Office 365, Dynamics CRM, Salesforce, Dropbox and OneDrive as well as on-premises systems like SharePoint, SQL Server, Oracle databases, SAP and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The apps are made available through the central PowerApps app on iOS, Android and Windows Phone, as well as on the web. Sharing them with co-workers is just a matter of sending a link to the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PowerApps complements the infrastructure of Azure, since it enables in-house developers to build data connections and APIs to existing business systems. Developers can manage existing corporate APIs using Azure Active Directory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft's interest in business apps is nothing unique, with companies like Salesforce and Pipedrive already invested in the market. But its brand recognition and good reputation holds it in good stead.&nbsp;</p>

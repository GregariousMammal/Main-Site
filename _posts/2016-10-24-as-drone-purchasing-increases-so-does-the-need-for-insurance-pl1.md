The use of drones is evolving from their role in military strikes to
support, commercial and recreational roles around the world. These
include the use of drones as first responders in Denmark for
[firefighting, chemical accidents and larger car
accidents](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dji-and-eena-partner-to-promote-first-response-missions-300247747.html)
in urban and over-water environments, shark harvesting in Australia,
delivering medical aid in Rwanda and in tests by German lifeguards for
[sea rescue drowning
scenarios](http://dronelife.com/2016/08/12/german-drone-company-demonstrates-lifeguard-drone/).

Then there's the intended [drone delivery services](https://www.hyl.io/)
planned by online retailers such as
[Amazon](http://dronelife.com/2016/08/12/german-drone-company-demonstrates-lifeguard-drone/) and
the bizarre stunt to [deliver beef jerky by
drone](https://readwrite.com/2016/09/22/behind-scenes-jerky-bot-dl1/).
Not to mention that almost every start-up tech conference will have a
low flying drone or two observing the action.

It would be fair to say that the potential applications of drones in our
daily lives are only limited by our imagination. But as the commercial
application of drones expands on an almost daily basis we can see
evidence of a legal and regulatory minefield that is struggling to keep
up with the evolution of drone technology

Setting laws for hobby and commercial drones
--------------------------------------------

The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) [published new
regulations](https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=20515)
in August pertaining to the commercial use of drones. Previously
commercial drone operators needed to have a sports pilots license or
higher. Now, all you have to do is pass a new aeronautical exam. Under
the new rules, operators can't fly drones higher than 400 feet or at
night. The drones must also weigh under 55 pounds and must remain in the
visual sight of a human operator — something that prohibits any kind of
long-distance drone use, including even the most basic delivery drones.
Commercial drones will also only be allowed to operate during daylight
hours or civil twilight. Also disallowed are any operations from a
moving vehicle — unless you are in a “sparsely populated area.”

[Hobbyist and recreational drone
users](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/fly_for_fun/) are
required to register their drone with the FAA (a mere \$5 for 3 years)
and adhere to some fairly common sense rules consistent with that of
commercial drones like remaining in site of the drone, avoiding
aircraft, sports stadiums and emergency response scenarios and not
flying under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

A technology ripe for insurance claims
--------------------------------------

However as the use of drones expands, so does the need for insurance. I
recently spoke with Sentil Rajamanickam, FSI Strategy & Operations
Manager at data analytics company
[InfoGix](http://www.infogix.com/) about the challenges of underwriting
drone insurance. He explained:

> "Today, [drone]{.il} insurance underwriting is based on a geospatial
> map used to determine the likelihood that a [drone]{.il} will have a
> safe flight. Simply basing underwriting on geospatial mapping can
> wrongfully calculate the risk of an accident. What if unexpected
> weather hits or a temporary structure (e.g. construction equipment)
> gets in the way that isn’t picked up by the mapping?

> One inherent flaw we’ve observed with non-traditional insurance, like
> [drone]{.il} insurance, is that it tends to be driven by past data.
> Past data doesn’t always accurately predict the future and when
> something unpredictable happens there is a higher probability of very
> large losses."

One way to offset such unpredictable, complex risk underwriting is to
leverage risk models that are based on the statistical data across a
particular region or country and that constantly correlate risk events
with pricing. The challenge for underwriters is that they are limited by
the data available for such complex underwriting analysis due to
non-scalable management information systems or core systems that cannot
support complex data requirements.

The somewhat contradictory situation is that drone insurance metrics can
be improved by increased drone flights, where drone users fly drones
which record flight paths, height, speed, aerial mapping etc. and can be
used as a leverage for the price point of insurance or as a precedent of
good 'flying' history in the case of future litigation.

Are hobbyists just waiting to get sued?
---------------------------------------

Rajamanickam cautions that many recreational users may not be aware of
the regulations such as the need to register and weight and aerial
height regulations and note that "as recreational users are slowly
increasing there's a real need to educate them." Retailer Best Buy, has
posted [safety
brochures](http://www.modelaircraft.org/gov/docs/safetyinsert-bestbuy.pdf)
in more than 1,000 stores and Amazon posts links to the [Know before you
fly](http://knowbeforeyoufly.org/) website in its retail section. But
it's easy to imagine scenarios where an errant drone user operates the
drone upon receipt on their birthday morning only to cause havoc with a
neighbour's garden, pets, windows or small children.  Could a s[cary
scenario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGCJiS3mCak), during Halloween
this year result in a lawsuit of emotional distrust? Maybe add a clown
or two.

Then of  course, there's the potential for breaches of privacy just
waiting for those who operate drones with filming capabilities.  In
terms of privacy protection on a national level, there are the
[Voluntary Best Practice
Guidelines](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/voluntary_best_practices_for_uas_privacy_transparency_and_accountability_0.pdf)issued
by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA).

They essentially warn drone operators to give notice before flying, to
secure data that is collected and don’t share it and comply with state
and local laws. Note that these are as of yet, only voluntary
guidelines.  Yet this could potentially be the biggest catalyst for
potential lawsuits, particularly against commercial drone companies who
undertake aerial surveillance and filming.

The reality is that the insurance needed by drone operators will evolve
as our range of drones and use expands. If you're planning on buying a
drone as a gift for a loved one this Christmas, adding an insurance
policy might not be a bad idea.

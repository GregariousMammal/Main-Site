<p>I&#39;ve been in Germany for a couple of months now and of course there the obvious signs you&#39;re not a local when you open your mouth, but here are couple of other subtle ones I&#39;m noticing:</p><ul><li>I&#39;m so used to putting my left foot down on the curbside when stopping on my bike I can&#39;t stop now I&#39;m riding on the right. Hardly anyone else does that.</li><li>Germans wear their wedding rings on their right hands, we wear them on the left.</li></ul><p>This list will update over time, keep checking back!</p>

<p>A poem written completely in predictive text</p><p>Fancied damaged boy any box or coy Cox kiss lips as they lisp.<br />Awake, cycle, be late and laud Kate.<br />Wall walk, tall talk, the next newt goes for God&#39;s loud love by Jove.<br />The tie vies for kid&#39;s lies, lids off with odd Ned picking and shaking his sibling in the lame land lane.<br />If he goes in, I&#39;m gone home, good.<br />Gas has, ice had, water waves and rates save.<br />Jesus jests while pests rests.<br />For eons the doors shut in situ, waiting, waving their dues for ever.</p><p>Published in Unpublished</p>

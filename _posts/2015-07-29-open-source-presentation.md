In recent months I have been attempting to make as much of my work and creative output as open and collaborative as possible. Since most of my output being code and markdown, this has been relatively simple.

However, I give a lot of presentations about open culture and it seemed a little hypocritical that I was delivering them through closed, non-collaborative software.

Whilst MS Powerpoint has gained competition from applications such as Keynote and Prezi, they are all still closed and only semi-collaborative formats. Crucially, they are all 'dead-end' formats, i.e. a powerpoint file, is just a powerpoint file, it can't be easily re-used or interpretted as a part of anything else. What I mean by this will become clearer later.

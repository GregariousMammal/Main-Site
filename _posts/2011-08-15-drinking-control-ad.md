I've sometimes been critical of drinking control ads in the past, generally wondering how effective they really are, but I really liked this one I found in a London toilet.

Why do I like it? Well:<ul><li>It's well designed and laid out</li><li>The pint of water imitates some beer brands and marketing</li><li>The main slogan is a good play on words that may hopefully attract the people the ad is aimed at</li><li>The secondary slogan is also slightly clever, even though it's been echoed before.</li></ul>

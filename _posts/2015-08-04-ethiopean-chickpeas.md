I make lots of [hummus](http://atravellingcook.com/2015/04/smoky-hummus.html) but I also enjoy chickpeas in salads and one pot dishes. Here&#8217;s one I used to make back in Australia when I was teaching cooking to Chinese migrants and their kids. We&#8217;d add whatever veggies were in season to bulk it up, and everyone enjoyed it, even the kids who claimed they didn&#8217;t like vegetables!

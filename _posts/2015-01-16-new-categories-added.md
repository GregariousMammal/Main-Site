I added a set of new categories and related resources to the Lean Traveller site yesterday including [Communication](http://theleantraveller.com/communication), [travel](http://theleantraveller.com/travel) and some resources under [archiving](http://theleantraveller.com/archiving).

I reorganised the category structure somewhat and updated my Scrivener project set up to reflect these changes and better move forward with new topics and those in progress.

The site is still a bit messy whilst I figure out quite what the direction I want to take it is, appropriately, I'm running things in a Lean and Agile way.

I spent some time thinking about a slogan and then gave up until I've addressed the thoughts above.

Next week I am having a design and coding week so will finally be getting round to implementing some much needed features in the site.

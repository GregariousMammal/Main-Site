<p>A great session tonight with two case studies from local Drupal shops&hellip;</p><p><strong>ACCA and content hubs from Monkii</strong><br /><span><a href="https://www.monkii.com.au" target="_blank">Monkii</a> work strongly with UX personas, building profiles of potential users before embarking on web projects, with the relaunch of the <a href="https://www.accaonline.org.au/" target="_blank">ACCA</a> site, content hubs were built to suit</span><span>&nbsp;explorers and first timers to sites,&nbsp; they have a rough idea of what they are looking for, but only broadly.</span></p><p>Here&#39;s an example -<a href="http://www.accaonline.org.au/learn" target="_blank"> www.accaonline.org.au/learn</a><br /><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">They help guide a site visitor to where you want them to go and utilise &#39;m</span><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">eta&#39; content types for highlighting &#39;real content&#39;.</span></p><p><em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">On a technical level the site uses</span></em></p><ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Custom colours through the colorfield modules, this is to allow content editors to create colour schemes per section.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Dynamic style sheets that are loaded as and when needed</span></li><li>View modes, which I feel are underused</li><li>Masonry modules to allow for the reflowing layout</li></ul><p><strong>Equiem/@rialto - Digital strategy for a building</strong><br /><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The basic premise of the project was giving a way that their buildings could offer &#39;something else&#39; to stand out from the crowd of other office buildings in the city. Retaining tenants through community and bridging disconnect. Not really anything similar at the time, a useful tool for others.</span></p><p><em>Features include</em></p><ul><li>Loyalty club</li><li>Time of day based promotions</li><li>Reseller functionality</li><li>Items that are available now, multiple retailers.</li><li>Skill sharing</li><li>News</li></ul><p>All carried out with a variety of contributed modules and customisation, perhaps to be revisited another time.</p><p><a href="https://atrialto.com/" target="_blank">atrialto.com</a><br />&nbsp;</p>

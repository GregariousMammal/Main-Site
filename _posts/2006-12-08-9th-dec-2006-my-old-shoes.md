<p>Here are my old shoes...<br /><br />They&#39;ve been everywhere with me, in four oceans, all over the world, on beaches, up mountains, traipsed through many cities...<br /><br />but they had holes in, and after their trip into the Indian Ocean, they smelt...<br /><br />So, they&#39;re gone :-(<br /><br />But I have some nice new brown ones now :-)</p>

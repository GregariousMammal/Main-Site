Recently a group of Blockchain enthusiasts at the co-working space I occasionally work from decided that it was time we stopped talking about Blockchain and actually learned how to create something based on it. We wanted to create a coin or token for the community to use internally, and whilst the project has stalled for now, I started investigating Ethereum in more depth, and the language it uses for creating smart contracts, Solidity. I will cover the language itself in more detail in the future (when I understand it more myself!), but in this post, I will cover some of the tools available for working with the language.

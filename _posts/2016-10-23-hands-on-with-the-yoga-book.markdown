When I saw the announcement of the yoga book at ifa I was immediately hooked.  A tablet with a proper keyboard, and a graphics tablet that I could doodle and even write on. Sign me up!

I immediately placed an order with Lenovo, realising that their online store wasn't quite as advanced or friendly as apple's. Waiting with baited breath, not really certain what I was going to receive,  or when it would appear.

About a month later it showed up and I was happy to see that the package did include a 'livenpen' (More on that later), a notebook (More on that later),  but unfortunately, a German keyboard, as already mentioned,  Lenovo's customer experience is not as great as others.

I've been using the device for a couple of weeks now, at home and on the road,  so I thought it was about time I told you all about my experiences with it.

## Physical dimensions
The yoga book is wonderfully light and easy to carry around, with a slightly peculiar sticky plastic feel to the casing. It has Lenovo's 'watch strap'hinge that has previously been seen on xxxii. Open the yoga book at 'Laptop' angle and the keyboard lights up, open it more than 90° and the keyboard switches off,  ,to become a 'normal' tablet.

### Tablet
Despite having a near second tablet wrapped behind it, it doesn't make reading or browsing on the tablet feel any heavier, but hot palms end up making the haptic back pad grubby quite quickly, which doesn't affect functionality,  but I like things clean. One of my uses for the tablet was to read magazines,  comics and other large format books, and I have found the screen crisp and clear enough for me, once I had tweaked a few settings here and there to suit my preferences. My only complaint would be that thanks to the location of the hinge and the combination design, the volume and power buttons are not where you expect them,  being on the top/bottom instead of the sides.

### keyboard
Most of the complaints levelled against the 	Yoga Book Haß Been against the 'Keyboard', and for not being 'real'or 'normal' enough. It does take some getting used to, and Android isn't optimised for physical keyboards, so sometimes struggles to keep up with the speed of some typers. It does result in a frequent mistakes, but I'm still happy to offset the accuracy with convenience. Personally I ended up switching off the Haptic feedback, and was happy with the fully 'soft' Keyboard. Granted it's an odd idea and despite Lenovo's best attempts, getting the software and hardware to interact takes some tweaking,  the options are there,  but balancing the various custom and Android preferences to get the feeling you want takes some effort.

### graphics tablet
The integrated wacom tablet is the unique selling point of the yoga book, and was what mostly attracted me to the device. I love technology but still do find doodling and writing on paper often the most fluid way of expressing (initial) ideas. I was hoping that with the excellent handwriting recognition of evernote (and other tools) I would be able to doodle notes on the tablet and have them ready and searchable,ready for further expansion. Despite my poor handwriting, I was still able o get evernote to recognise some of  my handwriting, and if my handwriting was better, it would probably recognise more.

## software
One of the other criticisms of the yoga bookcase been that whilst the hardware is fascinating, the choice of operating systems (Android and windows ) holds the device back. I have the Android version, mostly because pre-reviews of the device claimed that the CPU and memory would struggle with running Windows.
I was looking for a way to have a small device I could take travelling for most of my work, likely excluding coding activities or hardcore image/media editing. I briefly had an iPad in my possession, and whilst I found it restricting, there were many occasions where (less mainstream) apps were far better than the Android equivalent, for example markdown editing, github usage, and the Adobe mobile apps. I have also found that  several apps are unreliable, or don't work at all, most crucial / annoying being that lastpass keeps crashing, but I have also found twitter inconsistent and that switching screen orientation confuses many apps. maybe this is thanks to Lenovo's customisations, or Android's still inferior tablet experience.

](atc-migrate/2015/08/20950091465_1f4bdb7d9e_z.jpg) [<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1276" src="atc-migrate/2015/08/20940321352_1bdd66205d_h.jpg" alt="20940321352_1bdd66205d_h" width="1600" height="1419" />](atc-migrate/2015/08/20940321352_1bdd66205d_h.jpg) I like to keep a lot what I call staples in my pantry for when I want something simple to cook that isn&#8217;t pasta or toast. My staples include coconut milk, tinned vegetables and beans, rice, small jars of curry paste and miso paste ( I write more about this in my cookbook [Soups, salads and sides](https://sellfy.com/p/AnEq/)). I also keep potatoes, garlic, ginger and onions in the pantry and always frozen peas at least in the freezer! This makes it really easy to cook lots of different things without having to go shopping, especially on Sundays when supermarkets are closed.  A lot of resources on saving money and reducing food waste rightly espouse batch cooking but the reality is, the food needs to be tasty or you won&#8217;t want eat more than once! Having curry pastes, sauces, spices etc on hand at all times makes this a lot more easy.

This curry isn&#8217;t exactly authentic but it is tasty!

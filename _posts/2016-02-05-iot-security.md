excerpt: With more connections comes more risk
---
The growth of the Internet of Things  has been predicted over the last
few years and has led to a plethora of connected devices. Household
devices have led the charge with smart thermostats, refrigerators, and
washing machines. We have seen security devices like home security
cameras and baby monitors, and health devices like insulin pumps and
pacemakers. And we all know about wearables like fitness trackers and
watches.

It's hardly surprising to read that concerns about device security have
been raised, often in the same breath as the announcements celebrating
the new technology. The latest  gadget to fall under scrutiny is
Internet-connected baby monitors, with parents up in arms after
discovering that the devices are easily hackable.

There's been a number of  reported cases of parents discovering hackers
watching and talking to their children at night, and last week New York
City Department of Consumer Affairs launched an investigation into the
security of baby monitors, issuing [subpoenas to four manufacturers of
baby video
monitors](http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hack-alert-nyc-regulators-warn-parents-secure-their-baby-monitors-n505391)as
part of an investigation into the security vulnerabilities of the
devices. The  [Federal Trade
Commission](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/your-baby-monitor-secure) has
followed suit with a page of
[warnings](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/your-baby-monitor-secure)
on their website.

However, reports of baby monitor hacking are not something new, with
security issues being raised [as early as
2013](http://www.wired.com/2013/10/baby-monitor-hacking/). News reports
have pointed fingers at [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), a search
engine launched in 2013 which can be used to find Internet of Things
(IoT) connected devices around the world. Shodan scours the Web for
devices which use Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP port 554) which are
left open without basic password protection - - or only the default
password settings - - in place, taking a photograph of what an be seen.

But historically, there are plenty of devices without cameras that are
vulnerable to attack from the [Toyota
Prius](http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2287192/defcon-hackers-release-ford-and-toyota-car-hijack-data) to[ insulin
pumps](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/27/fatal_insulin_pump_attack/)
to [wifi
kettles](https://www.pentestpartners.com/blog/new-wi-fi-kettle-same-old-security-issues-meh/),
although admittedly some are hacked as demonstrations into the ability
to do so rather than with malice, it's still sobering stuff.

Who's responsible: manufacturer or consumer?
--------------------------------------------

It's not unreasonable to believe that a person who buys a connected
device and utilizes it according to the manufacturer's instructions has
a right to privacy, security and a relatively hack-free existence. But
this comes with the expectation that a consumer will update and install
security patches. Bear in mind that most people don't even read the
terms and conditions [when they download an
app](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/15/i-read-all-the-small-print-on-the-internet)
or [install free wifi in a public
space](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/29/londoners-wi-fi-security-herod-clause), let
alone install a home security device or baby monitor.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released a
[report](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-staff-report-november-2013-workshop-entitled-internet-things-privacy/150127iotrpt.pdf?_ga=1.47104549.344034108.1452451014)
into IoT privacy and security in early 2015 which detailed the issues
and issues a series of recommendations for companies developing IoT
devices. These included:

-   build security into devices at the outset, rather than as an
    afterthought in the design process;
-   when a security risk is identified, consider a “defense-in-depth”
    strategy whereby multiple layers of security may be used to defend
    against a particular risk;
-   consider measures to keep unauthorized users from accessing a
    consumer’s device, data, or personal information stored on the
    network;
-   monitor connected devices throughout their expected life cycle, and
    where feasible, provide security patches to cover known risks.

The last point is particularly interesting, with the onus on developers
to monitor connected devices. How often and to what extent is not clear.

The report also suggested ways of educating consumers including video
tutorials, affixing QR codes on devices, and providing choices at
point-of-sale, within set-up wizards, or in a privacy dashboard.

It's worth noting, however, that the report concerned data gathered
through meetings 18 months prior to its release. Technology moves fast
and recommendations, however commendable, may lack the required impetus
to create industry change.

What is the legal precedent?
----------------------------

Several of these principles alluded in the FTC report are illustrated by
the Commission’s first case involving an Internet-connected device. The
[FTC filed a complaint against security camera maker
TrendNet](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/09/marketer-internet-connected-home-security-video-cameras-settles)
for allegedly misrepresenting its software as "secure." In its
[complaint,](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/140207trendnetcmpt.pdf)
the Commission alleged, among other things, that the company transmitted
user login credentials in clear text over the Internet, stored login
credentials in clear text on users’ mobile devices, and failed to test
consumers’ privacy settings to ensure that video feeds marked as
“private” would, in fact, e private.

As a result of these alleged failures, hackers were able to access live
feeds from consumers’ security cameras and conduct “unauthorized
surveillance of infants sleeping in their cribs, young children playing,
and adults engaging in typical daily activities.The complaint came after
hackers breached TrendNet's Web site and accessed videos from 700 users'
live-camera feeds - - many of these videos were published on the
Internet.

The case was settled with stipulations including requiring the
company to obtain third-party assessments of its security programs every
two years for the next 20 years. TrendNet were also required to notify
customers about the security issues with the cameras and the
availability of the software update to correct them, and to provide
customers with free technical support for the next two years to assist
them in updating or uninstalling their cameras.

### Legislation to Protect Drivers from Auto Security and Privacy Vulnerabilities

In July 2015 Senator Ed Markey introduced the [*Security and Privacy in
Your Car (SPY Car)
Act*](http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SPY%20Car%20legislation.pdf),
legislation that would direct NHTSA and the Federal Trade Commission to
establish federal standards to secure our cars and protect drivers’
privacy. The SPY Car Act also establishes a rating system — or “cyber
dashboard”— that informs consumers about how well the vehicle protects
drivers’ security and privacy beyond those minimum standards. Some of
the specifics:

-   Requirement that all wireless access points in the car are protected
    against hacking attacks, evaluated using penetration testing;
-   Requirement that all collected information is appropriately secured
    and encrypted to prevent unwanted access; and;
-   Requirement that the manufacturer or third-party feature provider be
    able to detect, report and respond to real-time hacking events.

Security of IoT devices degrades rapidly. Whilst protection should be
present in every stage of development, new vulnerabilities can easily
appear and IoT devices that were once considered adequately secure may
no longer be trusted. But security has always been a part of modern
life, as has meeting the needs of consumers. Consumers won't stay
ignorant for long thanks to renewed media attention. Without regulation
and consumer pressure to require companies to act, it is unlikely that
technology companies will provide 'term of life' protection for
consumers.

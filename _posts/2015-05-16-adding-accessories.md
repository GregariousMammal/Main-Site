<p>Sorry for the lack of updates, I have been traveling with work the past few weeks.</p><p>However, I have managed to find the time to start adding accessories to the <a href="/cards">product cards</a>. Accessories are smaller products that can be attached to other products, even other players&#39; products. They represent things like mice, keyboards and a plethora of others.</p><p>Generally they are small cost and small return, but let you take advantage of other products for cheap wins. There are more to come, I am currently researching what was actually released in the 80s.</p>

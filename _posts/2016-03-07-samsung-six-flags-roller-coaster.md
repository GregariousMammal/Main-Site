excerpt: New partnership allows for use of Samsung Gear VR system in a real theme
  park, doubling up on the roller coaster thrill ride
---
Six Flags Entertainment Corporation and Samsung Electronics America
[recently
announced](https://news.samsung.com/global/six-flags-and-samsung-partner-to-launch-first-virtual-reality-roller-coasters-in-north-america)
a partnership which names Samsung as the “Official Technology Partner”
of the world’s largest regional theme park company. The partnership
includes the debut of ground-breaking experiences coming to nine Six
Flags theme parks— North America’s first Virtual Reality (VR) roller
coasters, using [Samsung Gear VR
powered](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/wearables/gear-vr/) by
Oculus.

The launch comes less than a month after I recently experienced a
Samsung VR roller coaster at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
Consistent with theme park reality, you line up patiently until it's
your turn - over an hour in my case. You then are seated in a special
seat with a hidden motor beneath it, and you strap on your seat belt and
don a Samsung Gear VR headset. My experience is still slightly blurry,
due to my glasses-wearing, but without them I couldn't see anything at
all. 

Loud music starts and an image appears of [a Six Flags amusement park in
California](https://youtu.be/Df4V0I3oEGs). All of a sudden, your seat is
moving and you are in the first car of a roller coaster train. You are
above the trees and you can look all around you - you can see the sky
and get a birds' eye view of the amusement park. The train starts to go
up a hill and you are climbing the tracks.

The adrenaline kicks in as all of a sudden, whoosh! Your train drops
down the roller coaster track with you in it. It’s not as visceral as in
real life - your stomach drops only a little - but the 4D experience
does make you feel like you’re on a real roller coaster ride. Your chair
moves and you are mildly tossed and turned. I left the experience a
little dizzy but in good spirits. 

**How will it play out at Six Flags?**
--------------------------------------

Some of Six Flags’ most popular coasters will be equipped to allow
riders who are wearing Samsung Gear VR headsets. Visitors still
physically go on a moving roller coaster, but the VR headset provides
hyperreality — for example, riders may be transported to the future to
save the world from aliens. And they can even fire virtual weapons in
what Samsung is touting as the “first-ever interactive gameplay
technology on a roller coaster.”

“This remarkable technology is a definite game-changer for theme park
rides and represents everything our brand stands for—delivering the most
thrilling and innovative rides and attractions in the world,” said John
Duffey, Six Flags President and CEO. 

“What makes this partnership so compelling for consumers and the broader
tech industry alike is that both companies are committed to pushing the
boundaries of what’s possible – and bringing a VR coaster to life is
certainly a new and thrilling proposition,” said Marc Mathieu, chief
marketing officer at Samsung Electronics America.

My verdict? If you're already lining up to experience a roller coaster,
then definitely give the VR experience a try, especially if you are
already a keen gamer. VR and AR are the future of entertainment, so get
ready to strap in and ride.

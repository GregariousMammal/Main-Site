<p>This week Facebook company&nbsp;<a href="http://www.parse.com">Parse</a> announced the launch&nbsp;of new Parse software development kits (SDKs) for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tvos/">Apple’s tvOS</a> and<a href="http://www.apple.com/watchos-2/">&nbsp;watchOS 2</a>, so Facebook developers can build  immersive apps for the Apple TV and the Apple Watch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parse previously released support for the Apple Watch and App Extensions in April, which enabled developers to build apps with extensions running on Apple Watch alone—without having to rely on a constant connection to an iPhone.&nbsp;More recently, the company&nbsp;announced the <a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/open-sourcing-our-sdks/">open sourcing of its SDKs</a> in August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A major challenge &nbsp;faced &nbsp;by Parse was local storage with tvOS, and it decided to re-architect local data persistence from the iOS SDK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response to <a href="https://readwrite.com/2015/12/03/twitter-digits-tvos">the problem of logging into apps via tvOS</a>&nbsp;(difficult without a regular keyboard), the Facebook integration library has been updated to let users login to tvOS apps using the Facebook tvOS SDK by using just a few lines of code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both new SDKs, as well as the updated Facebook integration library are available on GitHub.</p>

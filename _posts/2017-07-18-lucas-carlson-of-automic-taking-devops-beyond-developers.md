It’s not often I interview someone who has been the founder of a major tech company, an accomplished novelist, and describes containers and chatbots as "pasé," but Lucas Carlson is an intriguing individual. In this interview, we talk about his role at Automic, recently acquired by Computer Associates, who aim to bring DevOps style automation and practices to anyone in a business, no matter their role. We sat down to discuss why the company hopes to achieve, the flaws in modern DevOps techniques, and much more.

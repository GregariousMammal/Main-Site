<p>One of the challenges of my new attempt to blog about all the events I attend is that some events are hard to write about there and then on the spot. Networking events being one of them, you can&#39;t keep whipping out a notebook/tablet to jot down conversations and, well, you may not find anything you want to write about.</p><p>Still, a challenge is a challenge&hellip;</p><p>Silicon Beach has been running for quite a while and despite a declining audience due to many other similar events now and their decision to cut sponsored bar (see my <a href="http://blog.thefetch.com/2013/08/03/the-golden-rules-of-meetup-etiquette/" target="_blank">Fetch post on Meetup etiquette</a>&nbsp;folks!), however they are still running with attendance enviable to most groups and some would say, better quality audiences now.</p><p>Who did I meet&hellip; Well.</p><p>A Telstra project manager who gave me some insights into their recent profit reports&hellip;</p><p>Some folks from <a href="http://www.edenexchange.com/" target="_blank">edenexchange.com</a>&nbsp;an entrepreneurs and funding marketplace.</p><p>An Investment Analyst from Australian Super. This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve met someone from &#39;old school&#39; financial advice at a startup event, interesting to see the space becoming far more mainstream.</p><p>Some folks from <a href="http://www.appster.com.au/" target="_blank">Appster</a>&nbsp;a mobile application development company. We talked development techniques and hoping to get someone for a future <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Melbournemobile" target="_blank">Melbourne Mobile</a> session.</p>

Despite being a Mac user for nearly 20 years, I have always had a soft spot for Ubuntu. Whilst they have not always been successful, I have respected their attempts to pull Linux into the mainstream and try new ideas and paradigms with it. They have weathered the storm of Ubuntu phone and Unity and are meeting success with two newer projects, The lean Ubuntu Core, and their universal Linux packaging format, snaps. I spoke with Dustin Kirkland, VP of product development and Jamie Bennett, VP of Devices and IoT Engineering at Canonical to understand more the strategy behind the projects.

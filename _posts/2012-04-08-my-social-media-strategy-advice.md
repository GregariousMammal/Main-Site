<p>Here&#39;s a quote/analogy I&#39;ve been using for a while to overarchingly describe a strategy for engaging on social media that I&#39;ve found helpful and descriptive.</p><p>&quot;If you walk into a bar and all you do is stand on the bar, screaming and shouting about yourself, would you expect anyone to engage with you? It&#39;s the same with social media&hellip;&quot;</p><p>In follow up to that and the issue of privacy, here&#39;s another analogy.</p><p>&quot;If you then started telling everyone where your keys were, your movements for the day, where your valuables were, your fears and weaknesses and a bunch of other personal details. You would expect some repercussions.&quot;</p>

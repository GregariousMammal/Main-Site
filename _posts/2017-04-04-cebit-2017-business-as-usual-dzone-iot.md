I’ve never been to CeBit before, but it’s reasonably well-known on the tech conference circuit for announcements, and as it’s only a two-hour train ride from home, I jumped on a Deutsche Bahn and headed to the Worlds largest fairground in Hannover.

The first thing that strikes you about CeBIT is the sheer amount of technology that you never knew existed. There are rooms full of suppliers of data center hardware, from gigantic rack mounting systems to network cable heads, to consultants who will handle the whole job of sourcing these myriad parts for you.

I&#39;m still getting the assets together for the Google Play store release of &#39;Answers Against Humanity&#39;, but in the meantime, if you are so inclined, you can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/samurailink3/hangouts-against-humanity" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

I warn you it&#39;s probably terrible code, this is&nbsp;the&nbsp;first Java i&#39;ve written in nearly ten years!

I'm still getting the assets together for the Google Play store release of 'Answers Against Humanity', but in the meantime, if you are so inclined, you can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/samurailink3/hangouts-against-humanity" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

I warn you it's probably terrible code, this is the first Java i've written in nearly ten years!

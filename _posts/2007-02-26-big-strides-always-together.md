Despite my suspicions that Big Strides may have a lot of money behind them (headlining the Electric Ballroom already?) this is a brilliant single. Each track has a different style from bluesy-funk to mellow Ballad, un yet still possessing a similar feel and sound, all superbly captured and recorded. Three boys to watch out for.

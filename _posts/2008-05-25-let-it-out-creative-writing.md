Tell me what the matter is, I really want to know.<br>Don't keep it to yourself; you've got to let it go.<br>Don't tell me it's not important, I really do care.<br>Don't tell me another time, lay your burden bare.<br>Don't sit there feeling sorry with your head against the wall.<br>Talk to me, relate, and forget about it all.<br>

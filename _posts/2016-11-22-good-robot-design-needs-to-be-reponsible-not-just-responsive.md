Robots have become commonplace in many aspects of life including [health
care](https://readwrite.com/2016/04/24/robots-replacing-humans-in-customer-care-pr1/),
[military](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/06/drones-playbook-white-house-nsc-obama-clinton-trump) and [security](https://readwrite.com/2016/09/02/robots-replace-us-dangerous-jobs-pl4/) work.
Yet until recently little thought has been given outside of academic
circles to the ethics of robots.

[Silicon Valley Robotics](https://svrobo.org/) recently launched a Good
Robot Design Council - - which has launched “5 Laws of Robotics”
guidelines for roboticists and academics - - on the ethical creation,
marketing and use of robots in everyday life. The laws state:

-   <div id="1fac">

    </div>

    Robots should not be designed as weapons.
-   <div id="a481">

    </div>

    Robots should comply with existing law, including privacy.
-   <div id="69df">

    </div>

    Robots are products; they should be safe, reliable and not
    misrepresent their capabilities.
-   <div id="742c">

    </div>

    Robots are manufactured artifacts; the illusion of emotions and
    agency should not be used to exploit vulnerable users.
-   <div id="593f">

    </div>

    It should be possible to find out who is responsible for any robot.

The laws have been adapted from the EPSRC 2010 [“Principles of
Robotics”](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/ourportfolio/themes/engineering/activities/principlesofrobotics/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}. In Britain a few months ago we saw a similar
document, "[BS8611 Robots and robotic
devices](http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030320089)"
by the British Standards Institute (BSI) presented at the  [*Social
Robotics and AI* conference](http://socialroboticsai.com/) in Oxford as
an approach to embedding ethical risk assessment in robots. It was
written by a committee of scientists, academics, ethicists, philosophers
and users and intended for use by robot and robotics device designers
and managers to help people identify and avoid areas of potential
ethical harm. Like the US laws, it contains sentiments underpinned
by Isaac Asimov's ['Three Laws of
Robotics,"](http://www.auburn.edu/~vestmon/robotics.html) and it
asserts:

“Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm
humans" and also that“humans, not robots, are the responsible agents; it
should be possible to find out who is responsible for any robot and its
behavior.”

Dan Palmer Head of Manufacturing at BSI
[said](http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2016/april/-Standard--highlighting-the-ethical-hazards-of-robots-is-published/#.V-e4_ZN95E4):

> “Using robots and automation techniques to make processes more
> efficient, flexible and adaptable is an essential part of
> manufacturing growth. For this to be acceptable, it is essential tha t
> ethical issues and hazards such as dehumanization of humans or
> over-dependence on robots, are identified and addressed. This new
> guidance on how to deal with various robot applications will help
> designers and users of robots and autonomous systems to establish this
> new area of work.”

> .wp-image-7742 .aligncenter width="640" height="427"}

Whilst the standard builds on existing safety requirements for different
types of robots, covering industrial, personal care and medical, it also
recognizes  that there are potential ethical hazards from the
integration of robots and autonomous systems in everyday life,
particularly when robots are in a care or companionship role such as
with [children](https://attain.news/story/8767) or
the[elderly](http://www.parorobots.com/index.asp).

Robot design and emotional connections
--------------------------------------

![picture-1-640](rw-import/Picture-1-640.jpg){.size-full
.wp-image-7743 .aligncenter width="640" height="400"}

For a while, you could buy costumes for
iRobot [Roomba](http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/entrepreneurial-kids-at-myroombud-expand-roomba-roombud-costume-line-and-distribution-for-2006-10521.php)
vacuum cleaners. The [PARO Therapeutic
Robot](http://www.parorobots.com/index.asp) is used in nursing homes
around the world as a companion for the elderly with great success. But
what happens when the relationship ends? One need only look at the
grieving that occurred when Sony's AIBO robotic dog  - - released in
1999 - - was discontinued in 2006 with the announcement repairs and
spare parts would be discontinued in 2014. For many owners, it was like
watching a pet slowly die. There were even [Buddhist
funerals](https://www.dramafever.com/news/dead-robot-dogs-can-now-get-a-proper-buddhist-funeral/%7B%5B%7Bnotification.object.url%7D%5D%7D)
available for AIBO dogs in Japan. The reality is, when people are
associating robots with pets or humans, they are attaching  an emotional
connection to them.

Robots for love and maybe more?
-------------------------------

The idea of robot lovers is not a far-fetched as it might sound. Films
such as [Her](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/) and [Ex
Machina](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/?ref_=nv_sr_1) and the
television series [Humans](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4122068/)present
a future where humans fall in love and/or want to have physical
relationships with AI and robots. However, there are currently no widely
available sex robots in creation. The closest correlation seems to be
incredibly lifelike sex dolls including extremely disturbing ones
featuring
[children](http://www.vice.com/read/japan-trottla-dolls-lifesize-lingerie)).

Sex business entrepreneur Bradley Charvet [has revealed his plans to
open a sex robot café in
London](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/10/01/sex-robot-cafe-open-london/),
where visitors will be able to receive “cyber-fellatio” while drinking
tea. “Sex with a robot will always be pleasing and they could even
become better at techniques because they would be programmable to a
person’s need. It’s totally normal to see a new way of using robots and
others sex toys to have pleasure.”

The issue of robots and human attachments at such a level causes
discomfort to many. The second annual *[Love and Sex with
Robots](http://loveandsexwithrobots.org/)* academic conference was
supposed to be held in Malaysia in November 2015. But in October, the
Inspector-General of Police [declared the conference
illegal](http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/10/13/igp-declares-sex-with-robots-conference-illegal/),
highlighting the country's conservative morals and likening robots to
deviant culture, and it had to be canceled abruptly. The next conference
is in London in December. There's even an organization "[Campaign
against sex robots](https://campaignagainstsexrobots.org/)" that
predicts their existence is not that far away. They believe that:

> "The development of sex robots will further reduce human empathy that
> can only be developed by an experience of mutual relationship. We
> challenge the view that the development of adult and child sex robots
> will have a positive benefit to society, but instead further reinforce
> power relations of inequality and violence."

Even forensic [researchers into the
treatment](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2099607-could-sex-robots-and-virtual-reality-treat-paedophilia/)
of sexual deviance claim that:

> “It’s very important to understand this because we need to do more to
> prevent child sexual abuse and exploitation. And it’s only a matter of
> time before dolls are souped up with artificial intelligence. How
> lifelike can they get? Will more realistic technologies help reduce
> the problem, or make it worse? We need to start figuring out what the
> impact will be. The cost if we don’t explore it is intolerably high.”

What about robots and physical violence?
----------------------------------------

 

![la\_county\_sheriff\_bomb\_robot\_2](rw-import/LA_County_Sheriff_Bomb_Robot_2.jpg){.size-full
.wp-image-7747 .aligncenter width="512" height="340"}

While robots aren't sentient androids (yet), it's worth remembering that
robots[ ]{.apple-converted-space}*[are]{style="font-family: Georgia"}*[ ]{.apple-converted-space}currently
committing acts of violence. Drones, essentially flying robots, are
utilized to strike in[ ]{.apple-converted-space}[armed, unmanned
combat](https://dronewars.net/drones-and-targeted-killing/) in civilian
and war zones. Then in the US we've recently seen a scenario where
a[ ]{.apple-converted-space}[robot was used to detonate a
bomb](https://readwrite.com/2016/07/12/killing-dallas-shooter-robot-right-choice-dt1/)[in
response to a police killing, ultimately leading to the death of Micah
Johnson who killed five police officers and wounded seven others in
Dallas. This action sets a new precedent in how these robotic devices
are being used at home. As Ryan Matthew Pierson
writes:]{.apple-converted-space}

> "This is the first known case of a United States police department
> using a remotely positioned explosive to kill a suspect. Where gunfire
> and other means of lethal force are unfortunately common practice by
> police in the United States, using a robot to administer that force is

If military and police are excluded from the "do no harm" pledges of the
Good Robot Design Council and BSI, what kind of precedent is
established? What role does defense play in robot ethics with the
creation of robots designed to kill during police or military
operations? Will ethics be able to keep up with the technological
advances and indeed growing uses of robots?  Only time will tell.

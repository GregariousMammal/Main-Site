<div><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">There was a slightly strange feeling to this meet up, in some ways it felt a little insular (I guess those who are actively involved with BitCoin are a small and intriguing community), but it could also just be because it was for once a crowd of folks I didn&#39;t recognise.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">There was an underlying feeling of &quot;Everything old is bad&quot; and &quot;Everything new is good&quot;, which isn&#39;t always completely true or as black and white as that.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">I find Bitcoin interesting technically and as a concept, if you think about the history of money, then bitcoin is no different really, it&#39;s an agreement to trust that a concept has a mutual value between people. The money we use everyday is no different from BitCoin really, it&#39;s just decentralised.

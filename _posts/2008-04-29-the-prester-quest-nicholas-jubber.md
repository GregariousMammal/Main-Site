<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The prester quest is a story of two men&#39;s present day retracing of a journey from Italy to Ethiopia made by a Papal Emissary in 1177. His mission to deliver a letter to a supposedly (and widely believed to be) real King of a fantastical Christian land in the heart of Islamic lands. I read a similar &#39;retracing the steps&#39; book (Victoria Clarks, The Wayfarers) about a year ago, which was an amazing read, so this book had a lot to live up to. It starts slowly and doesn&#39;t really get going until about a quarter of a way through the book, the author&#39;s slightly facetious tone initially rather annoying and patronizing. However once the plot and journey kicks in the book is a gripping read full of interesting facts, observations and experiences from History and their eventful journey across several countries, continents and cultures.</span></p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Prester-Quest-Nicholas-Jubber/dp/0385607024" style="line-height: 1.538em;" target="_blank">www.amazon.com/Prester-Quest-Nicholas-Jubber/dp/0385607024</a></p>

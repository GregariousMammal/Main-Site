This week I have added rules to the &#39;<a href="/manual/playing-game">Playing the Game</a>&#39; section of the manual to cover the following:<ul><li>How and when products pass from being private in a player&#39;s factory to being public in the general playing area.</li><li>What happens when players run out of certain resources.</li></ul>

I added a <a href="/content/accessory">game concept to cover accessories</a> (keyboards, mice etc).

Finally, I am speaking at the Berlin Game Scene&#39;s <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BerlinGameScene/events/220863773/" target="_blank">Talk &amp; Play event next week</a> about Chip Shop, so I have been preparing for that.

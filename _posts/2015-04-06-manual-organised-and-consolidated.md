<p>I spent today drawing together the disparate parts of the game manual and concepts into something more cohesive and readable, it can be found <a href="/manual">here</a>. I used the Drupal module <a href="http://drupal.org/project/menu_block" target="_blank">Menu Block</a>&nbsp;so that the manual can be organised as pages and sub pages (with associated menu links) and the structure then shows correctly. This will enable me to add and edit more in the future and everything will fit together nicely.</p>

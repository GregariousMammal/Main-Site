In this video you'll be building upon previously learned techniques by taking data imported via API and displaying it to the interface. We'll learn how to get into the API data, get it into a usable format, and then once it is properly formatted, attach that data to the interface to make a usable implementation of the API data that, in this example, you are fetching from the Marvel API.

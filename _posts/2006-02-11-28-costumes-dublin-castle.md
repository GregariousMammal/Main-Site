Wow!<p>28 Costumes are awesome! Catchy songs, with choruses that leave you singing until you're tucked up in bed. So tight, I don't think there was a single note out of place, and full of humour, a song breakdown that involves snoring noises is a new one on me. Bursting to the seams with character and good songs, 28 Costumes are a kick in the face to the pussy footing of lots of bands in the current music scene, definitely one to watch if the scene has any sense.<br><br><a href='http://www.28costumes.co.uk' target='_blank'>www.28costumes.co.uk</a>

I find this small collection of images documenting London&#39;s derelict underbelly appealing for two reasons. I know the author from his days as an Indie label &#39;boss&#39; and the fact that he turned to a successful sideline in snapping pictures of abandoned buildings is fascinating. Secondly a lot of the subjects within the book are familiar to me, sometimes in the same state as within the book and sometimes in their previous non-dilapidated state.

My own connections aside this is a great little book of fascinating images of abandoned buildings, wasteland and other images of London&#39;s abandoned side. The (small) physical size of the book makes some of the images annoyingly small when really this should be a coffee table sized book, but that&#39;s more than likely a Publishers decision.

The descriptions accompanying each photo give an insight into the mind of the author, full of references to London football teams and amusing anecdotes to reveal a side of London that you either didn&#39;t know about or much like the subjects, had forgotten about.

Every now and then along comes a piece of software that just does pretty much everything right, one of these is Dash.

Ok, it&#39;s a documentation browser for developers, so has a limited appeal, but it&#39;s makers have really thought through a lot of it&#39;s configuration and layout. Why would you need this? Can&#39;t you just go online for documentation? Well, yes you can, but sometimes you&#39;re not online and if you&#39;re like me, sometimes you just like an app.

Why is it awesome?<ul><li>It has heaps of documentation sets (that I need) including PHP, Drupal, MySQL, CSS, Twig, Smarty and many more.</li><li>It integrates with heaps of other tools in my workflow such as Alfred, Sublime, XCode and many more, allowing for instant lookup to functions.</li><li>It has a great layout that can be switched between a standard app and a HUD style display.</li><li>Alongside searching any documentation you&#39;ve downloaded it also searches Google and Stack Overflow for your query.</li><li>It doesn&#39;t bug you to pay for an unlocker, but if you love the app (and I do) it&#39;s only $20.</li></ul>

It&#39;s simple, but so well executed.

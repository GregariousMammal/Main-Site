Many of us are impatient for a future where telehealth reduces our visits to health professionals. Whether you are geographically isolated, tired of waiting hours in a waiting room for an overdue appointment or simply have felt the pain of dragging yourself from your sick bed to a doctorâ€™s surgery to acquire a sick note for an employer, consumers are keen to see a change.&nbsp;Current health providers are expanding their services to include remote health. Health tech startups such as&nbsp;mediconecta&nbsp;and couch&nbsp;are creating new stand-alone services for remote care.

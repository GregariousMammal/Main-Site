I have started building the site for the &quot;One Day the World Ended&quot; project in Ruby on Rails and thus needed some designs. Here are my very rough ones so far&hellip;[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_large","fid":"128","attributes":{"alt":"","class":"media-image","height":"480","width":"333"}}]]

I doubt you can really see this, but it shows a typographical heavy white text on a black background with fixed header and footer for navigation.

[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_large","fid":"130","attributes":{"alt":"","class":"media-image","height":"480","width":"347"}}]]

This is the crowdfunding toolbar when readers can vote and bid on the stories they want to read.

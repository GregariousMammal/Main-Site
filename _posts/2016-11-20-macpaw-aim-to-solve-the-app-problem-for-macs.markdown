There are currently two major issues and trends with app development. One is users finding your efforts, and the other is then maing money when they do.

Major software vendors like Microsoft Adobe, and JetBrains have been able to make sucessful revenue models with recurring billing models for software, but this is a challenge for smaller developers. How can they maintain enough reelases to justifiy a monthly fee? Services like [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com) have helped in someway, but there are typically one-off marketing pushes than a regular sustained income.

Setapp from MacPaw aims offer this solution, by creating a flat-fee subscription service for Mac users and developers. On initial launch it felt like a cross between DropBox and Steam, as Applications are installed into a special location and into a _Setapp_ folder inside your _Applications_ folder. Even before downloading anything the folder is over 100mb in size (for a current 45 apps), not a major issue, but I wonder how large it could become.

Fron inside the folder, choose an app, and double-click it, this will show you an information screen from where you can click _open_ to start downloading teh app. As these are standard Mac applications you have access to any of the standard OS X features like Spotlight and Services. Even deleting an application the normal way will instantly recreate the 'alias' file from when you first installed Setapp.

Setapp aims to make the experience as seamless and 'Mac-like' as possible, but also adds a unified updater, something that the Mac App store aimed to do, but it is limiting to many developers. If you are looking for more developer-focussed software then tools like MacPorts and Homebrew have filled the gap, but they are very dofferent use cases.

## Devmate
Devmate is MacPaw's solution for managing updates, liscenses, crash reports, feedback, distrubiotn, management, payment and more(!). It offers a more flexible alternative to the Mac App store whilst still offering similar features and purpose.

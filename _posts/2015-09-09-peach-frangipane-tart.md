This is a recipe I&#8217;ve been meaning to make for a while as the summer fruits are coming to an end. It&#8217;s very simple and a delicious dessert for a special occasion! The pastry is a lovely biscuity texture and works well for a range of sweet desserts.



_Ingredients:_

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For the pastry

  * 150g cold vegan butter
  * 1 1/2 cups plain flour
  * 1/2 cup icing sugar

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For the frangipane filling:

  * 1/3 cup vegan butter, softened
  * 3/4 cup caster sugar
  * 1 cup almond meal
  * 1 tablespoon plain flour
  * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract/powder
  * 3 tablespoons chickpea brine
  * 2 cups peaches, sliced thinly (remove the skins if you wish, it will change the appearance rather than the flavour if you do not)
  * Water and sugar to brush the top

_Instructions:_

  1. Place the flour and icing sugar in the bowl of a food processor and blitz for a moment (or mix well in a bowl)
  2. Add the butter and mix until you have a coarse sand-like texture.
  3. Tip this out onto a work surface and bring together with your hand until you have a lovely, smooth disc of dough, adding a little water as needed.
  4. Wrap this in plastic and pop in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
  5. Roll out between two sheets of baking paper until about 5mm thick and drape into a loose-bottomed tart tin.
  6. Return to the fridge for another half an hour.
  7. Preheat oven to 180C.
  8. Cream the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy and add the almond meal, flour, vanilla and chickpea brine.
  9. Mix until smooth.
 10. Blind bake the tart shell (I do this my topping the shell with baking paper and dried beans and baking for 15 minutes).
 11. Spoon in the frangipane mix and smooth out.
 12. Press the apricots into the mixture and bake for 50 minutes or until the frangipane is golden brown and cooked through.
 13. Once cooked and cooled, brush the top with a little sugar dissolved in hot water to create a gloss.

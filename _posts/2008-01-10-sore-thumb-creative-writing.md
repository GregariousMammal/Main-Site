When you feel like the odd one out, like a fish whose water&#39;s run out.<br />You don&#39;t look like them but do you even care, the smell of suspicion hangs heavy in the air.<br />What does he want, why is he here?<br />No one thinks to ask, to talk to you, to find out what you think, what you believe, what drives you, what motivates you to sit in a cold room sticking out like a sore thumb that&#39;s been hit with a hammer.<br />I thought we were independent thinkers, the ones willing to think about things differently, so why judge me for looking normal?<br />I&#39;m not after anything, I&#39;m not snooping, casually seeing what you&#39;re up to, reporting back to someone.<br />It&#39;s just me, little old me, with my own thoughts, ideals and ideas.<br />Just me, sitting alone, resplendent in my own opinion, awash in my own beliefs, not sat on the fence, just unsure as to which side the grass is greener.<br />Still making my mind up, still weighing the options, because if you don&#39;t ask you wont know.<br />If you don&#39;t question you can&#39;t answer.<br />Right isn&#39;t always wrong and left isn&#39;t always right.<br />The Good guys might be bad lies and there isn&#39;t always a need to fight.

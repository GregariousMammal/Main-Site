relayr is an IoT platform as a service, aiming to help IoT developers centralize and aggregate the data generated by IoT connected devices. By installing their hardware and software SDKs you donâ€™t need to worry about specific SDKs and data types generated by various devices, but instead code against the relayr APIs.

relayr began with the Wunderbar, a custom IoT prototyping tool that provides a multitude of sensors and adapters. In May, the company released the Proto IoT Android app and I met with two of their team (Bernard and Marcos) here in Berlin to discuss why they created the app and what developers can do with it.

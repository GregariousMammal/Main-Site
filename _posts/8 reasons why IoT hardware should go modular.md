# 8 reasons why IoT hardware should go modular  
![](http://atravellingcook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/baner_v4.jpg)


It would be easy to search the internet and come to the conclusion that there are thousands of successful hardware products hitting the market. What's less apparent is the challenges inherent in product creation, particularly for start-ups who may be producing their first product. Hardware is hard but it is possible. We're working hard at nexpaq to make it possible for for IoT developers to make their very own custom modules for nexpaq phone cases. Whether you're a hobbyist or hardware professional we make it easy with a toolkit and API. 


###1. Hardware costs money

It's not always as simple as just establishing a kickstarter campaign to get funded. Only 1 in 10 Indiegogo and 1 in 3 Kickstarter campaigns [manage to reach target](http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/7/4594824/less-than-10-percent-of-projects-on-indiegogo-get-fully-funded). We were lucky enough to exceed our goal, but it was bloody hard work. 

Then of course, there's the number of hardware products that never happen for a multitude of reasons. For example, SciO, marketed as a mini moleculor sensor able to that is [now unavailable](https://www.consumerphysics.com/myscio/scio/) due to an [intellectual copyright dispute](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/903107259/scio-your-sixth-sense-a-pocket-molecular-sensor-fo). Then there was [PeachyPrinter](http://www.peachyprinter.com/), who promised a $100 3D printer but their financial officer spent the money on building a house and fellow co-founders are urging backers to contact the local police.

We remove the financial barrier. With us you can simply buy a modular developer kit that includes everything you need to develop your own modules including a PCB board, components and online access to nexpaq documentation. Once you make a product beyond a prototype, it can be sold with our other modules without you having to quit your job and bootstrap or do an exhausting crowdfunding campaign. 

##2. Protyping can be hard

Prototyping can be hard when you're first starting out. Wearable device CEO Niina Venho explains: 

>"The reality with hardware is that funding is always your number 1 concern. You have to physically make the product and hardware components are expensive especially when you are starting off and only want to buy 2 pieces, 5 pieces. The more you buy the cheaper it is, like if you were to buy one million components it is considerably cheaper. But you donâ€™t do this in the beginning so you have to pay a lot of money to get the components together and put the first prototype together yourself".

Separation of concerns allowing different aspects of design to be worked on and improved independently of each other

A modular device uses modules that have the same initial framework, making it easier and more affordable to try things out. Think about it. Once you have the know how, you can create multiple prototypes with different capabilities. Get them working, test them extensively and see what happens. 



## 3. Manufacturing becomes accessible and more affordable

A modular system unites the advantages of standardisation (as parts can be produced cheaply in large amounts) with the advantages of customisation (since a large diversity of unique objects can be made with relatively few parts). This brings the prices down. 


## 4. Modularity encourages affordable innovation

The nexpaq community promotes innovation. Our modules can include [personal health monitoring](https://nexpaq.com/news/connected-devices-bring-early-intervention-to-health-care/) for the quantified self and the [collection of citizen data](https://nexpaq.com/news/iot-and-citizen-data-the-first-step-in-eliminating-air-pollution/), and it's foreseeable that community members will create modules that complement and contrast with those that will be initially released. Shared ideas and interests have a way of feeding off each other and growing to be something great. 

##5. Modular makes scale easier

Another hidden cost most people don't think about is regulatory approval and safety certification testing. 

In the US, consumer devices containing a processor are supposed to have FCC approval even if they don't intentionally transmit radio signals. Some products may additionally need FM/CSA/Intertek safety marking to be sold at retail outlets or to be installed in certain commercial/industrial settings. Average cost of regulatory and safety testing is between $5,000 and $50,000 depending on the complexity of the product, the testing required, and how many tries it takes to pass. Those numbers do not include the cost of your engineering staff's time putting together the documentation nor the costs of creating a new revision of the product to correct any deficiencies uncovered by the testing.


Whilst it's easy to imagine making small scale products, what you want to make may not be financially or technically possible at a larger scale. Module development comes with a legacy of precedence of what did and didn't work (not to mention multiple prototypes). Think of it like getting a blueprint before you start work. nexpaq modules contain elements of uniformity in design and materials. This reduces the time and difficulty of construction. 


##6. Your consumer market is expanded 

A lot of people think they can set up a twitter account, facebook page and online shop and they're good to go. Branding, photography, press releases, and packaging are all extremely complex skills that can be time consuming and expensive. Whilst some people have the arrogance to believe they can rely on word of mouth and plain packaging, the reality is that getting people to buy your product in exchange for their cash involves a complicated range of decisions. Being involved with a modular product that has the potential to appeal to a range of different audiences which increases your market-people are unlikely to buy a modular phone case and only one or two modules, the more to choose from, the more they'll buy. 


##7. Modularity makes going retail a reality

Whilst it's easy to imagine that you just build a website and people will flock to buy your product and you'll sell out in one day, the reality is that bricks and mortar in-store sales still account for over 90% of all retail transactions. Success in retail ranges from who stocks your product, how many they hold, how and where they display it in store, how many products are actually sold and what you make from each sale. Then there's related issues like packaging and freight that are more complicated than they first might appear. When you're part of a modular product, a lot of the pressure is reduced as you have a team of people who have experience in retail and are hustling on your behalf. 

Ultimately nexpaq is working to create an excellent consumer product. But we're also creating an excellent developer product. We want to make it possible for people-whether hobbyists or professionals-to create great products by creating modular components for our phone cases. The future will be modularised, find out more [here](https://nexpaq.com/intro/).

##Modularity allows product growth

Shipping your first hardware product is hard, but it is not the top of the mountain, only the first base camp. 

As a hardware startup company, you likely will need to continually iterate and improve the product after it is introduced to the market. This can sink significant funds and shorten your cash runway, as every major change requires new tooling investment.  This is a significant hardware startup disadvantage.  Even after sales have begun, it takes careful planning to reach positive cash flow through the months/years of early product improvements.

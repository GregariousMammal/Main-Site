The [Centre for Urban Science and Progress](http://cusp.nyu.edu/) at New
York University has recently released the findings from a smart
city [pilot
study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1609/1609.08780.pdf). It's the
first in-depth analysis of a local New York Neighborhood intent on
measuring the quantified community. They utilized IoT sensors to collect
and analyze quality-of-life measurements at high spatial and temporal
resolution in the neighborhood of Red Hook, Brooklyn.

Red Hook is an economically disadvantaged neighborhood. There is no
subway service, only a few Internet hot spots and close to 70 percent of
the population lives in New York City housing projects. Residents
experience an asthma rate of more than 2.5 times that of the national
average and more than a third live below the federal poverty line. The
life expectancy of residents in Red Hook is 10 years lower than the
national average. Red Hill was significantly affected by flooding caused
by [Hurricane
Sandy](http://portsidenewyork.org/portsidetanke/2013/02/red-hook-sandy-surge-map.html)
in 2012.

The measurement of quantified communities is a long-term neighborhood
informatics research initiative. Researchers will study three New York
neighborhoods-Hudson Yards, Lower Manhattan, and Red Hook. They aim to
collect, measure, and analyze data on the physical and environmental
conditions and human behavior of each neighborhood to better understand
how neighborhoods and the built environment affect individual and social
well-being.

Between physical environment and social health
----------------------------------------------

Researchers explored the correlation between the physical,
environmental, and social components of the community. Baseline
community measurements focused on environmental measurements including
air quality, temperature, pressure, humidity, and luminosity.

They collected air quality data, particularly PM2.5 concentrations
(which have been shown to have a direct impact on cardiovascular and
cardiopulmonary health) at the street level. Coupling this data with
building energy use data allows them to explore how the quality of the
built environment, human behavior, and environmental conditions interact
to affect public health.

Researchers  explored the impact of an [urban heat island
(UHI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island). This is where
man-made urban surfaces (such as concrete and asphalt) lead to an
increased heating of the surrounding area. UHIs are linked to
respiratory health conditions, high energy consumption and pollution.
Localized temperature quantifications enable researchers to ascertain
the connection between temperature, physical environment and resident
health.  The result can assist local authorities to identify buildings
and communities vulnerable to heat waves and other heat related
emergencies.

Citizen science makes metrics inclusive
---------------------------------------

A new urban sensing platform was developed for the project, the QC Urban
QoL Sensor. This is a low-cost, but reliable sensor array using the [5V
Trinket Pro](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2000)by Adafruit
Industries. The devices measure air quality, noise, light levels,
pedestrian counts, and temperature/pressure/humidity.

When the sensor data is combined with administrative, mobility, social
media, and Wi-Fi usage data it can create a neighborhood profile to
benchmark changes over time and compare to other areas of the city.
These measures are designed to help communities identify and solve
problems, focusing on issues of environmental health and mobility,
through new sensing modalities, analytics, and data visualization. The
[Red Hook Initiative](http://rhicenter.org/) (RHI), a local social
services community organization, was enlisted to install the sensors and
engage with the local community to provide additional, volunteered data.

Four sensors were installed Red Hook at different heights. Local
residents were also provided with portable sensors for a short period of
time to measure temperature, noise and air quality at five-second
intervals. This provided an opportunity to  identify problems through
data science by those that know the area best.

While IoT technologies are viewed as the next generation of urban
infrastructure, low-income and economically distressed communities are
often not the focus of urban and civic technology deployments, and the
question of equity continues to be overshadowed by expedience in many
technology-led city strategies.

Great opportunities for collaboration
-------------------------------------

The efforts of CUSP correlate well with other community projects such as
[Red Hook Wifi](http://rhicenter.org/red-hook-wifi/) which aims to bring
free local Wifi to residents, [Hack Red
Hook](https://pioneerworks.org/hack-red-hook/) where participants
created projects such as [HighGround.nyc](http://highground.nyc/), a
system that manages vehicle evacuation during emergency flooding
situations. There's also [Open Sewer Atlas
NYC](http://openseweratlas.tumblr.com/), an open source mapping and data
project that aims to assist in the improvement of wastewater /
stormwater management by organizations with limited access to technical
information and data.

In regard to whether it is possible to elicit sensor data that can be
utilized to influence local community or public policy, CUSP's results
have so far been somewhat underwhelming.

The biggest spike in air pollution was attributed to a local community
BBQ.  But researchers have been successful in creating a community
project that involved local residents. Their data is only from the first
of the three neighborhoods to be compared and contrasted. It's a great
opportunity to compare different neighborhoods and the impact of land
use, and ultimately involve citizens in smart science within their
community.

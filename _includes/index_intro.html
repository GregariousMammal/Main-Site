<p>I am Chris Ward (aka Chris Chinchilla). I am a Developer, Designer and Writer currently living in Berlin, but originally from London and with many years spent in Melbourne.</p>
<p>This site is the home of many of my personal and work projects and the experiences I have working on them. All have a thread of openness, exchanging knowledge and new ideas.</p>
<p><b>Why do you call yourself Chris Chinchilla?</b> Hmm, yes it does sound rather silly doesn't it! It's a nickname I've had for over 12 years after a passing comment at school, I've carried it through all my fanzine and music years and quite like it. For those who are interested, a Chinchilla is a small (and very cute) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinchilla" target="_blank">South American rodent</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinchilla,_Queensland" target="_blank">Small Town in Queensland, Australia and is a real name in South America.</a></p>
